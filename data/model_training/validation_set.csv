cywcnf0,becomeaman,"The term ""caring"" has taken quite a hit. You shouldn't demonize the concept of caring, but I understand exactly what you mean by saying it.     I read what you wrote, and it's evident that you have an emotional wound. Your quick temper, as you're aware of, is a response to your insecurity being activated or revealed - an overcompensation or fight defense by your body to combat the, now nonexistent, threats.     My prescription, as I have made leaps and bounds in terms of progress regarding similar issues, is to get into mindfulness. Reading and more information will not help you, so get out of the self-help literature world for the time being. You need to become mindful of your automatic mental, emotional, and physiological reactions. You need to sit/lay in silence for at least 30 minutes per day with no sensory distractions (music, smoking, tv, phone, etc...) and simply observe what's going on in your body and head. By doing this, you give your body the time and attention to heal itself. As a result, you get what you want, i.e. a consistent state of feeling calm, powerful, clear, energetic, and the natural exuding charisma that will draw good people to you during interactions.    By doing what I said above habitually, you will ""decondition"" the bitchboy in you, which will pave way to your authentic self that you deeply know you can live from.     I hope this helped, and I'd be interested to see how this helps you if you are doing it consistently. PM if you have any questions. It's a good sign of heading in the right direction that you're deciding to seek help.","Would agree 10/10. Mindfulness activities like reading, meditation and yoga have helped me emotionally and focus-wise quite a bit, maybe even more than spiritually (if that means anything to you). My spirituality is very developed but my emotional side is severely damaged from childhood emotional trauma (bullying, lost parents, beatings, loneliness) and the mental imbalance, with added stress and sleep deprivation, drove me to madness. With a focus on my mindfulness I overcame so many issues and reached stability. ",0,newcomer

The idea that all radical feminists are all white is just modern third-wave bullshit meant to discredit second wave ideas, by implying that there's a white woman way of thinking and a black woman way of thinking, when in reality any can think just about anything.    It may be true that the majority of second wave feminists were white, but that's just because the majority of people in the US (and other Western countries) are white, especially university students, since they represent a more privileged portion of the population.

I'm a virgin at 23 and honestly at some point I desired it a lot but I eventually gave up because it seemed worthless and pointless to me, especially after I discovered masturbation at 20. Women genuinely can get sex whenever they want, because sex for men is really just that, sex, nothing deep, nothing to think hard about. They just wanna get off and sadly use vulnerable women for that because they know they're easy to get. I genuinely wouldn't take it as a compliment when someone approaches you or finds it okay to have sex with you immediately without ever spending a decent amount of time together.     Yes you may feel pissed and be like I want sex, I wanna feel desired, I want to feel loved and love back and all that jazz but those feelings will disappear soon enough when, again, you realize that for men sex is like the 'basic' need they have.

It is also biologically in a woman’s best interest to prefer commitment as she needs help raising a child and protection. TRP beliefs are founded in a lot of shallow biology like this.

fjnz48i,MoreTankieChapo,"Let’s talk about Notch, Anti-Semitism and Villagers It is not an unknown fact that Persson has had some *questionable* takes in the recent years. His past comments on gender, LGBT+ and other socially oppressed groups have lead to Microsoft distancing themselves from him https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/341690/Microsoft_distances_itself_from_Minecraft_creator_Notch_ahead_of_anniversary_event.php even. Notch in the past has tweeted phrases heavily associated with the alt-right, such as the time he posted to Twitter “It’s ok to be white” https://mobile.twitter.com/notch/status/936215345400033280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E936215345400033280&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnotch-whiteness-tweets . He has in the past also questioned societal privilege, a take used by the far right to justify their racism, sometimes to the point in claiming that it is whites that are disadvantaged and oppressed by society. This idea of “reverse-racism” is itself a manifestation of the alt-right’s denial of race relations in Western society, based on no factual grounds sociologically. Persson even claims privilege is a “metric” used to “repress”. Mr. Persson, privilege is not a metric to repress and silence, but an acknowledgement that certain races and classes, whites and the ruling propertied class, have societal advantages that puts other oppressed people at a disadvantage in society. Persson even states that checking race based privilege *is* racism. https://mobile.twitter.com/notch/status/936298788636983296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E936298788636983296&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnotch-whiteness-tweets . Persson has not been shy either to anti-Semitic rhetoric in the past. The triple or quadruple parentheses are used in far right wing circles to refer to Jews, more specifically, the Jewish Conspiracy. The far right uses these parentheses to refer to (((them))), the Jews. Persson even claims to have been silenced by the Jews, and this should not be surprising. It is clear Persson believes he is an oppressed figure in Western society, that he is being silenced by Leftists with their privilege checks, and their opposition to white nationalism. https://mobile.twitter.com/notch/status/1070773433045143557 . These actions have clearly demonstrated that Persson is someone of very far right tendencies, and he has manifested these thoughts more then once. These situations raise some eyebrows when we examine some of his works, such as the Villagers in Minecraft. Overly large noses, heavy dealings in money, usually giving deals that clearly benefit them. This is not un-similar to the stereotypical Jew. This is not me claiming this was the clear intention in the design of villagers, as Notch pointed out he modeled them after Dungeon Master 2 villagers. This may be true. But Persson has become just like Pewdiepie in recent months. Pewdiepie, having in the past done blatant anti-Semitic actions followed by his withdraw of a large donation to ADL and the wearing of an Iron Cross like image on livestream, have lead some to wonder if these are not just coincidences as both Pewdiepie and Persson claim. Again, maybe these are. But also these are adults, who should have clear understandings of what their tweets, memes, and jokes could be taken as, especially when they have had legitimate accusations of anti-Semitism and racism in the past. The bottom line to all of this is that these people such as Persson have such large audiences, and that they should take responsibility for their actions and use their platform and position to help end anti-semitism and racism, not give anti-semites and racists a place to dwell. Emerican Johnson has a great video essay further explaining this point, https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmRYRRDbuw . Fellow Minecrafters, let’s get Persson to be an activist against anti-semitism and racism, and let’s spread awareness for these oppressions in our society.",i don't like notch either but this got to be an joke,0,newcomer

deyg7qt,nazi,"Aryanist thoughts on nigger culture as you probably could tell from my last post, I despise niggers and everything they stand for. in my opinion niggers are the second most degenerate race there is besides the evil jews who control everything.    I think niggers have way too much influence over the culture where I live (usa) and have influenced a lot of stupid trends with their propaganda both here and in other parts of the world. hopefully my list of reasons will convince you as to why I think all niggers should be wiped off of the earth.    vine - vine is a stupid nigger website created by niggers for niggers. as you can probably tell all of the popular trends and sayings from vine have all been created by niggers. ""9 + 10 = 21"", ""what are those"", and ""deez nuts"" were all created by niggers. kids and teenagers here love these nigger jokes and one has even influenced the presidential election here (deez nuts). as you can probably tell, like all things the niggers do, these are codes for how niggers want to morph our society.    fortunately I am smart as I am the founder of aryanism and I can tell what the niggers are trying to do to us. ""deez nuts"" was created as a form of propaganda which I will go in more detail to later. the others show how dumb the niggers all are as they don't know what shoes are and cant do basic math. they want to change the fundamentals and truths of society like how math works and basic language functions...    harambe - harambe was an ape who was shot and killed for assaulting a baby if you don't know. he got the treatment he deserved, being a nigger who was trying to murder and potentially rape an aryan baby. harambe is huge on the internet however. the niggers started this whole trend. naturally they have sympathy for their close relative in evolution (yes niggers and apes are related, but they aren't with aryans). so they decided to spread lies about harambe saying he was trying to defend the baby and started a whole fucking meme about it and some people even worship harambe now and he polled at 5% in the election a few months ago.    rappers - rap is a nigger music genre. it was started to spread nigger propaganda around the world, and is easily the most vile of these forms of nigger propaganda as it has the most influence. todays kids idolize rappers even though they are all niggers and strive to be like their favorite rapper. there are no white rappers. all rappers are niggers. rap songs also contain lyrics about stuff that niggers tend to enjoy very much. these are things like murder, drugs, sex, and rape. the niggers are trying to encourage the new generation of white people to become the scum of the earth in order to create a new society filled with niggers and people who idolize them.    basketball - its a sport created by niggers for niggers. everybody loves basketball, but I know why it was made. basketball was made to show nigger dominance and is a clear method of propaganda. all famous basketball players are niggers, and they all take steroids as well. steroids are drugs so they're bad plus it makes the niggers seem better than they really are.  big dicks - nigger propaganda frequently says that niggers have large dicks and are amazing at sex. ""deez nuts"" shows this because theres a nigger in the video talking about his dick. however this is nigger propaganda endorsed by numerous nigger countries like uganda, ethiopia, and the congo. the nigger countries are behind all of this and are trying to influence white culture by trying to make niggers look like cool sex lords even though they look like apes and behave like them too.    the nigger objective - the african countries are supporting rappers vine and nigger culture by giving them money and trying to influence white people. the niggers are using this to create a new ""master race"" because they know their genes are bad and they need to combine it with white aryan genes in order to create niggers who can function in society.    so because of this niggers have been lying about the size of their dicks to get hot sexy aryan women to bang them and make the closest thing that can exist to a good nigger baby. unfortunately a lot of aryan women have fallen to this especially as it has been proven that aryan men have the biggest dicks. the niggers want to wipe out the white race gradually and are trying to force aryan men to bang either their ugly nigger women (who they know are inferior so they don't bang) or the fucking chinks and sand niggers.    we need to stop this injustice and create the aryan union.",What's the aryan take on twerking brother?,0,newcomer

Maybe you get some Q boomers to make a return but they're pretty sparse at this point anyways. Best case scenario for drama, he has another heart attack in office and you get endless speculation and conspiracy, maybe even a lefty-Q replacement.    I really don't see Bernie winning though. Even the bongs voted for the guy with bad hair over the socialist, there's no chance the burgers wouldn't follow suit. Trump has been a pretty solid investment for 24/7 drama thus far, I think 4 more years of seething + uncertainty over his 2024 replacement would be the best outcome.

I also liked the loss of menstruation that came along with starvation. It's interesting that the typical anorexic trope we hear involves girls striving for this feminine ideal, when I know many of us not only rejected our femininity, but also actively tried to starve it away.

c47ut1z,masculism,"Thoughts on James Deen and any of you ugly motherfuckers actually feeling desirable This is my first post on here, I've posted a bit on r/sexpositive and r/feminism but this isn't exactly appropriate for either of those subreddits..    I kinda hate the guy. Or am I just whining? Maybe that's a bit extreme, ""hate"" is a strong word so no I don't HATE James Deen but yes I am jealous in a way and I need to vent this. There's an actual serious discussion to be had, though.    For those of you who don't know him, look him up. He's a male porn star who has a huge following of young women. He's young, has the ""perfect amount of scruff,"" blue eyes, curly locks, he's slim, toned, giant dick, nice smile, and he is apparently so good at his job the women he works with actually love working with him - apparently he can actually connect with the women. Bear with me, my reaction to this is total jealousy, I'll admit. I feel fucking ugly in comparison, like there's nothing sexy about me, I'm a 6'0 gargoyle in comparison to him (he's 5'8 apparently), I'm 250 pounds (I've got 100 pounds on him), not a lot of muscle tone, I don't have a boyish face, no blue eyes, no nice scruff (patchy neckbeard if I don't shave) - I'm basically feeling like what the average woman probably feels when she's outside, faced with beauty ads and the like. But it's not a matter of him being better looking than me, tons of guys in the popular media are better looking than me and it doesn't get to me. I just sound like I'm trolling but I'm not.    Women fucking LOVE him, and he's in porn. He's banging the shit out of women and they're literally pulling him closer - I wouldn't be surprised if the women he works with aren't faking a thing. He's really rough, and women seem to lap that up. I don't watch mainstream porn because it's A) boring, and B) completely a false caricature of sex where everybody looks bad and C) what's to say there isn't a great deal of coercion going on and I'm unwittingly masturbating to what could pretty much be actual rape. However. His stuff is ""female friendly"" because the women involved actually are really into it so I'm basically watching 2 people having enjoyable sex. I can't get into that, there is something off-putting about it that makes me extremely uncomfortable. There's something comforting and familiar about emotionless, detached porn but I also hate that for what it is as well. I should be happy there's a guy like James Deen out there, as I consider myself a pretty liberal, sex positive, feminist ally kind of guy but I guess I have a way to go yet.    SKIP TO HERE FOR THE ACTUAL DISCUSSION    It's just the way he's so desirable, he desires the women on screen, the women on screen desire him, scores of actual women desire him, (his physical representation of a man in porn is nothing new really, he's another big-dicked in shape guy), and I'm left with nothing, I feel ugly and totally undesirable. Again, this goes beyond a mere superficial jealousy - I'm not sure if there are many men out there who feel sexy and desired and this is why I'm posting.    Generally, in porn, the woman is the object of desire, as false and cartoonish as it may be while the guy is more or less a disembodied penis who I guess you're supposed to mentally photoshop your face over. I've never done that but apparently that's what you're supposed to do. What happens in porn is what men want in real life, and the women in porn respond favorably because they love what is being done to them - they're eager servants. But in the stuff with James Deen, she's actually, legitimately enjoying herself and there's something about that that makes it hard to watch when you're not the one doing it to/with her. Maybe James Deen is just giving me a taste of what women have been feeling for ages and I'm all sour grapes about it.

dm3pws5,europeannationalism,"[[[Neoconservatism]]]---->Conservatism---->Lolbertarism---->NSDAP (for lack of a better word). My personal journey. I've been through them all. Each step to the next coming when I implicitly understood that the ideology of the former will simply wind us back in the same fucking spot. Because, like communism, all of these political ideologies sound good on paper but fail to take into account human nature and our natural biological impulses and drives that have molded and shaped our societies as our race has progressed through the millenia. Each evolving from different natural conditions, ingraining into our very DNA different innate behavioral mechanisms and cultural predispositions. Like an element on the periodic table. Each with their own properties and subatomic structures.     It doesn't matter what you do, if you do NOT name the Jew and understand why they really are ""The eternal enemy"", every single one of those above political philosophies will ultimately result in us going right back to this moment in time where we're at right now. The degeneracy. The hedonism. The diseased stated of moral decay rampant in our society. It'll all happen again because we fail to understand WHY we always seem to drift back towards destruction.     You have to study and understand HOW the Jews have turned our world into such a fetid shithole before you understand that the only cure is NSDAP ideology. And this isn't for a great society of 30 or 40 years --- which people always think is the standard metric of success ----- but for long term stability and ensuring that we will always be strong. Always secure in our futures.

Australia is a tough anti-authoritarian culture and not stupid and that is why in many ways we have not simply drifted into the Abyss. You think England is saved by Brexit? I don't think so. I think the horse already bolted and they are left holding the saddle and saying how they will ride it if or when the horse returns.     Bar a few East European holdouts and Russia, Europe is stuffed.     It is about changing the trajectory and gradually changing our society. Given good results in a non-Progressive culture, we will likely assimilate a more balanced approach to society and culture.     Enter Trump. Trump is NOT a messiah. He is flawed. He has not the articulation, charm, poise, eloquence or grace of Obama. That is problematic. On the plus side he is not a POS nor incompetent, so that is a plus.     Trump IS making mistakes and will continue to. He will not be perfect and I for one did not expect anything less. What I HOPE he does is to clean up the political and global class and show a better way to have society and culture conduct itself.     Any pie in the face of the ones that have run society and culture in the last 8 years is valuable to me. His success is cherished here by me. If he gives Australia and Australians something alternative to Merkel, May, Macron and Trudeau I am very grateful. I NEED Trump to succeed for my country's sake.     I don't honestly care too much if he doesn't or can't adhere to all his promises. Every promise and every day in his role brings the needle a little closer to a repudiation of what Obama/Merkel have shown. If Australia holds off from full-throttled acceptance of the Global order and Progressive values for a few more years that is a huge win. Why?    At teh end of Trump's 7 years, Europe will be a dumpster fire and the one bastion out of Eastern Europe will be USA......and Australia if we hold the line. At that stage we will see the state of Germany and Sweden and that England and France will be about at the point of no return and we will out of survival instinct  back the Hell away from that. In the meantime we will have to hope Trump's successes will give us pause. Give us an alternative.     How could I NOT fully endorse and support Trump","Its unfortunate we as a country are so spineless. We have that anti-authoritarian nature in our DNA but the marxists have brainwashed that ideal to being anti-Trump. They can't see that Trump is the counter-culture. He is the voice of the everyday people. He is the only one who was capable of taking on the Orwellian overlords that are trying to turn all of humanity into their slaves of both mind and body. Everyday i here someone say ""Trump is a moron, but.."" and then basically agree with something he has said, but they don't realise he is their voice on the issue because they are constantly drowning in Anti-Trump propaganda and are totally unaware of the deep state war. I feel blessed to be an Australian but it is truly scary how many people here are under the cabal's mind control. In Trump We Trust. Good OP, onya mate. ",0,newcomer

fnjb9ic,Ask_Radical_Feminists,">To what degree do radical feminists speak for them?     It's about all women, but of course there are ones with more power and those with less. RF tries to solve the problems of the ones with less, but sometimes the ones with more would have have to help out. Sometimes they don't want to.     >But what happens when the women it claims to speak for voice their disagreement? What one views as empowerment is viewed as degrading, conditioned behaviour by the other. What does this mean for getting more women (and men) on board with the movement, and accommodating inevitably varied viewpoints on sexual and social mores?    Idk, good question. I think women in general have common goals, just different paths they think would lead to those goals. Others are content in patriarchy or don't know about it.    >to what degree is there consensus on what a radical feminist society would look like?     There's not really such a thing. It's kind of like asking what a civil rights society would look like, or what a human rights society would look like, I'm not sure what you mean by this question.      >One issue that I've seen come up in discussions like this is that patriarchal societies are successful precisely because they most effectively exploit the labour of its people. Would a feminist society have to exploit its people similarly?     Why would it need to? All else being equal, feminism is just about the power relations between the sexes. I'm not sure it has to do with things like class oppression, other than solidarity and concern for poor women's rights. So I wouldn't rule out some oppression still existing while feminism is there, although we all like to think because we fight for any human rights, we also aim to improve all human rights.    >What traits would a radical feminist society have to adopt in order to remain relevant, assuming it would be competing with parallel patriarchal systems?     Competing in what way?     >(Just trying explore this issue, feel free to say if some of this seems too speculative or besides the point)    It's a _little bit_ too speculative. Radical feminism after all is not a political system, it's the belief that women are people. So asking what a radical feminist society would look like is kind of like, what would a society without murder look like. I guess, like the world now, but without murder? I guess, like the world now, but without exploitation?","I see - yeah I suppose I was asking about radical feminism as more than simply a set of ideals, but taken as a set of priorities that would directly inform policy making decisions. As in, to what extent does this belief system translate into a tangible political philosophy.",0,newcomer

I liked her a lot then but she blossomed in HS and I decided to try and woo her. I asked her out in middle school once and she politely declined, that's fine. We remained 'friends' (whenever she needed homework help I was the coolest thing since sliced bread but not when she was around her cool friends). I decided to up my game and literally start baking stuff for her to show how good I would treat her. I always would take an interest and listen to her, be polite to her, show up to her sporting events when nobody else would, and I always would try to help her out with anything she needed. I caught alot of flak but it was fine because maybe she'd like me. She rejected me again freshmen year, fine again, she maybe wasn't looking for anything.    Sophomore year she gets this boyfriend who is a stereotypical douche. She was smitten and I think he took her virginity, idk though. About 3 months into their relationship they have a convo that went something like: ""have you been cheating on me?"" and then he sent a video of someone else giving him a BJ.    I hear about this and me being my supportive self texted her and let her know that I still cared about her even though she was mistreated, she actually responded nicely with a huge thank you and asked how I was. She was on a roadtrip so she was bored and wanted to talk to someone, that someone was me. We talked for hours about everything hopes, dreams, our favorite memories, etc..  I even propositioned that we do something together sometime and she said yes! She was going on a cruise so she wasn't going to be able to talk with me for a week or so, so I waited a week and a day or two(didn't want to be annoying) and texted her, no response. I texted the next day and 3 days after that with no reply. She didn't respond but I definitely got a message: I don't want you.    That story pretty much sums up that even when someone thinks I am smart, friendly, supportive, funny, and kind I am not enough. Plenty of other women have gotten to know me more or less the same have turned me down as well, ugly and pretty alike.

dotln82,askseddit,<MISSING>,"I personally don't have much experience, so take the weight of my opinion as you feel necessary:    You have a lot of potential based on your mentality, and that's ok because we all make and learn from our mistakes.     The first thing I noticed is that you seem to have a tendency to overanalyze a situation, and that's eating you up:    *""She suggested getting one room and I happily agreed. I figured she must have some sort of interest in me because she suggested one room.""*   It could mean that, it could also mean something logical such as saving money.    *""She posts a picture of me on her instagram (which I took as an increased level of interest).""*   Ask yourself this if you put up a picture of a friend of the opposite gender on Instagram, does that automatically mean you're in to her? I'll say that at the very least it shows she acknowledges you.    *""I texted her to make sure she got home and said I had a good time and we should go out again (needy, bitch ass behavior), but she agreed.""*   There's a fine line walked between showing interest and being needy. If anything you're qualifying saying you had fun with her, and you'd like to be with her more. Not to mention you waited 4 days, that's plenty of time/space given.    Anyway, I don't think that admitting you had feelings for her was a fuck up, especially since you had chemistry & already took her out at this point. You were showing signs of interest after all (you noted on the first date you made attempts to escalate physically). You went for it, and she didn't straight up blow you off. What's critical too is that you didn't get salty, and went back to having fun acting like nothing happened, that shows interest, not neediness. I do feel that going for the kiss the next day was the only screw up, but that's only because when you revealed your feelings you learned she was hesitant. Going for it wasn't a massive screw up, it just verified that she's not interested romantically.    The best thing to do is to move on and continue on with your life, and not get hung up on her. If she does have some interest in you she'll come back at some point since she knows you're interested.     Anyway best advice I can give is try not to overanalyze and just go with the flow, and you haven't projected massive neediness based off what you typed. If anything the best thing to take away from this experience is that rejection happens and while it isn't pleasant, the best you can do is keep improving who you are and move on.

cmfkuz5,ferguson,<MISSING>,"After reading this post, I'm embarrassed to share your lack of pigment...    First, there is not a single person who would claim that it was your lack of pigment directly that inhibits the success of those who have alternative pigments. However the views that society has regarding the various pigments does inhibit people's success and it is a very serious issue. The fact that you took such a serious issue, redirected the blame to something ridiculous, and then tried to use sarcasm to throw the issue in the faces of those most hurt by the issue is low and disgusting.     Racism is not as prevalent as ever. We have come a long way from lawfully enslaving people. We have made a lot of improvement. However the issue is not over. Once the racism was taken out of our laws, it changed into a more subtle, hidden form. A good example was pointed out to me by one of the smartest men I ever met (and, I'm convinced, the smartest man I will ever meet in the neighborhood I live in). He said that he refuses to be called an ""African American"" because he was born in America, raised in America, and knows nothing at all about Africa. He is 100% American. You can call him black, because he is. But to call him ""African American"" implies that he is somehow a less pure American than I am, just because his skin is a different color. I had never thought of it before then, but he was able to see the real form racism takes in the modern world. All the higher-quality education that is more available to you because of your ""lack of pigment"", and you still aren't educated enough to see the more obvious examples of racism, much less the more subtle issues like that one that might just go by unnoticed for centuries to come. It's sad.    These benefits that you get for your ""lack of pigment"" leaves the black community at the low end of the economy, because we get first dibs at just about everything. This means they struggle to get their next meal. This means they have little or no health care, which leaves a lot of them to live in physical pain and sickness. This means they don't have time for things like education and maturity - the things that they need to be successful OUTSIDE of the ghetto where they are forced to live. They are stuck in a rut and their only way out is through drugs that take their mind off of their misery. Many of them live in such constant misery that they don't even realize how miserable they really are! What they do know is that it's a lot easier for people with your lack of pigment to get by in life. They also know that while the average white American is not personally ruining their lives, that same average white American sure isn't doing anything to help them, either. And if you have to pick someone to blame for the social views against those with darker skin, it sure isn't the people who have the darker skin. So who would you blame?    As a disclaimer, I will also add that there are definitely those people who don't even try. There are blacks who literally reap from the government, have kids so they can sit around and do drugs on the average American tax dollar. There are blacks who are ignorant and like it that way, who are criminals just to pass the time, who this-that-and-the-other-thing because no-good-reason-at-all. And those people are an embarrassment to the rest of the black community in a very similar way to how whites who get online and post ignorant shit about racism being ""clear and prevalent as it ever as"" and having ""a new target"", use sarcasm to twist a serious issue into a mockery and then use it to attack the people that the issue hurts the most, and then tell the BLACK community to stop being immature - that shit makes me embarrassed for MY race, too.",2,newcomer

cuo8i5x,marriedredpill,"Wow.  I mean, just wow.  I never thought of it that way, but now that I see it stated directly like that, it is clear that this is EXACTLY my problem.  Honestly, I only posted this because even though I have not quite finished all the pre-reading yet, this weekend was a major test that I failed and I wanted some ideas for damage control.  I am committed to finishing NMMNG today and will start on WISNIFG tomorrow.  I had no idea that this is the problem, and yet you have stated it SO CLEARLY, it is impossible to ignore.  So now, I must begin to make the necessary changes.  I am totally responsible for this, and I will do what it takes to set the proper boundaries.      One question: my wife knew about the child when we married and was initially alright with it, only giving me problems later.  Where I come from, you don't agree to something and back out later; you give your word, you are expected to keep it.  So, why did she agree with it at all?  The same thing with my parents: why did she agree if she was going to make it a problem later?  I can see if she had a legitimate specific gripe, but her accusations during the arguments are unfounded, and the arguments start because she gets it started.  Honestly, my parents (and my son) have done nothing to provoke a confrontation.     At this point the die is cast in these 2 situations, so I can only establish the boundaries going forward since I did not do it already.  My mistake, and I own that.  I will definitely pursue the Child Support issue with DCSE, since this seems to be the main point of contention concerning my son.    And you're right:    *""What can I do? They lost the reservation and they have no vacancies, yelling at them isn't going to make a free room appear."" I bet you've had a lot of fights along those lines, where you felt you handled things calmly and maturely, and just saw your wife being irrational and overreacting.  But it's your response of just shrugging and saying ""what can ya do, shit happens,"" that frustrates her so much, especially since you seem to respond that way with everyone but her.*    This is exactly my reaction to most things.  That will change.  I will start saying no to a lot of things going forward, because now I understand the problem.  Thank you so much for opening my eyes.  I have a lot of work to do now.  ","You are expecting your wife to act like a man when she isn't.  Men [should] give their word and stick to it, even if it's painful.  Women agree to things temporarily with the hope they can ""guide"" you to the ""correct"" decision later on.

Now, go back to the beginning and forget what **I** am supposed to produce and look at the **actual evidence** that **you can find easily from multiple reputable sources** and you'll see it's all there. I don't need to show my birth certificate for you to believe it exists, dumbo, there's plenty of ways to find the documents you're looking for. :)    But I suppose the best evidence that you know you're wrong is your inability to confront the fact that hundreds of Nazis gave corroborating testimony despite never seeing each other, never being in the same cell together and serving in different parts of the country. Or the actual records. Or any of that.    And, I just do not see how it would be any better if the Nazis *hadn't* gassed people and had only starved them and worked them to death ...    ... and I don't understand why you think that there wouldn't be fuel to run machines at Treblinka ... you think the engines run on nothing at all? But there's no evidence of the fuel coming in... so there could not be fuel, right? I mean, they must have had magic engines that ran on air and dreams.    And the records of slave labor being sold and rented, oh just hogwash. Hogwash. And the skeletal remains, oh that's just nonsense as well.

Anyone who tells you otherwise is either:  a) a woman   b) a lying beta male      Better looks= more options for you.     ~2~ Be more direct    Some guys suck at flirting.      Women can be hard to read.     So, if your flirting is not working ... maybe it's because the guy you're flirting with is not aware you're flirting with him at all.     ~3~ The Friendzone doesn't apply to women    The friendzone is a concept that applies to men. Not to women.    If a female friend changes her mind about a man and he finds her attractive, he will date her.     How so ?    Well, it's like an instant switch turns on in our brains.     Those dormant sexual feelings get instantly aroused when an attractive female friend expresses sexual interest.     So, Women can transition from friend to lover in a new york minute in the mind of a man.     Women don't work that way.     So, it's hard for you to accept that but here it is.    This is the mind of man.               ",Friendzone works both ways. Just that men do not have a habit keeping those women in close proximity when they friendzone them.

cqv16fj,NationalSocialism,"Minority Must Rule We National Socialists must never be discouraged by the fact that we are a minority with our ideas and beliefs; in fact this should encourage and assure us that we are all the more RIGHT as it is always the minority of people who are capable of greatness.Here is my take:      Why does it matter what the majority of people think? Since when does the majority of any population have enough credibility to be entrusted with something as important as voting for legislators who decide the fate of the country? I find it hard to find something that is more absurd than the idea of 'Majority rules'; Did the creators of this idea actually believe it could work, or did they know that with this idea they could make people believe they have a say in things when the really don't? In almost all the major parliament systems today, the real leadership usually lies with a couple people. The elected officials, serve the purposes that their masters set out for them while having to appear as if they're tending to the wants of the people that vote for them. The art of being a politician is making voters believe you are serving their interests so that you can be voted in again, but in reality you only serve your own interests as well as the interests of the groups who fund you, usually at the detriment of the voters and country you represent.  This can be seen in the United States mainly, as well as dozens of other countries who embrace the Democratic ideal. But this is not a new phenomenon, its as old as Democracy and parliaments themselves. So why don't the great majorities figure it out? Because the Majority of people lack the logical thinking, common sense, and knowledge of history to see the tyranny that they vote for every couple years. The masses of people are and will always be ignorant and even stupid, its how it has always been. The real power players behind the scenes reamin unknown to the people, so they never need to take responsibility for their actions, and are never subject to the wrath of the voter.  Only the minority have the qualities and skills needed to make decisions such as who should lead a nation, and thus to lead the Nation themselves.  People gladly get duped every year in elections all across the world, and have been doing so for more than a hundred years, there is absolutely no hope that they can free themselves  from their mental prisons. Only Leadership of the Minority, that is Dictatorship of the minority can lead these people to freedom.                             I judge the success of governments by how well the needs of the people are fulfilled now and in the future, and i don't see any one Nation who has done good in this department.  The interests of a people that consists of one race/culture is fulfilled by a state, or government.  This is at least how it would be in a perfect world; today in some places that end is observed to an extent by a couple countries. The common culture of one people is the first perquisite of creating a successful state, and there are some places in our world today that do maintain only one race/culture. A nation consisting of a whole multitude of races and cultures like the US are hopeless for the most part, and will slowly collapse from within.  Immigration and multiculturalism are ruining many countries in the EU today, and some people have actually realized this and have started protesting their governments.                                     The day when people become Racially aware, is the day where i can finally have hope for humans again. We always hear of  the problems we face today, like poverty, crime, hunger, and global warming but no one ever offers competent solutions. Why? Because the solutions are found only when people become Racially aware, and that is a big no no. Just look through liveleak and see the countless videos horrible behavior here in America. Are these your fellow Americans? Are you equal to these people? I certainly am not. I'm above these people, and it will always be so. I truly believe that Individual races should be separate form each other in their own lands. Multiculturalism and Multiracial ideas have been failures and it is only getting worse.                       All humans are not born equal at all. Some are born with the genes and mind that will result in a great human, while some are not. The human is born into a culture. A culture that has been determined by other humans before him. The culture is based on the people, so if you have a great culture, then the people who founded this culture is great. A bad culture is a result of bad inferior people. A good culture would let the human realize and make use of his natural gifts, whatever they may be, while a bad culture will usually just waste them. Animals are not born equal to each other, the stronger and smarter ones survive while the weaker ones will die off. Thus causing the whole species to be better off as the stronger individuals get to breed while the weaker ones don't. This is nature, do you think that nature does not apply to humans? Are we somehow exempt?","Exactly how I feel; technocracy is the only viable form of state today, but the big difference between neo-NS and judeo-democracy, besides both necessarily being technocracies, is that in neo-NS only those who have contributed and physically, tangibly, visibly helped their people (through contributions in all spheres of life) are the ones who get to lead, because they have proven themselves, whereas in judeo-democracy, the leaders are parasites who became powerful through fractional reserve banking swindling, IE doing nothing to help the people at all and even harming them. Its both technically ""technocracy"" IE a small minority need to control the technology, but its completely the opposite. In NS the minority controlling the technology are the ones who built the technology, whereas in judeo-democracy, it is the ones who subverted the society",1,newcomer

fbq5jfs,GenderCritical,"Point 2: Intersex is a disorder of sexual development. It doesn't constitute a third sex, it merely means something went wrong in the development of an individual. The cases where things go so far wrong that sex is truly ambiguous are apparently vanishingly rare.     Point 5: Someone basically asked about this just the other day in [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/edrq5t/who_am_i_i_cant_fit_in_anywhere/)     Point 10: As long as male violence against women is a problem, it really is relevant in everyday interactions whether a given person is female or male. Many women will for example have no problems with being alone late  at night with a female acquintance, but would think twice before doing that with a male acquintance.     Point 11: I have nothing against sex-neutral third person pronouns as such, however the languages that already have those would also have other practices and structures that reduce any ambiguity that comes about from the lack of sexed 3rd person pronouns. As English has evolved to separate these pronouns by sex, it lacks these additional practices. Merely inserting non-sexed 3rd person pronouns into English as it currently is, is therefore unlikely to work very well.  There also have been numerous attempts to introduce neutral pronouns, but they have so far all failed. For some reason, English seems very attached to sexed 3rd person pronouns. I don't see that changing any time soon.","Thanks!     2: Yeah that makes sense. To me this point is largely irrelevant but it’s cited a lot by those who are defensive of the whole unlimited genders thing, so I’d rather concede to that semantical issue so I can discuss the meat of the issue.    5: Thanks for the link, I’ll read up on it    10: Yeah on that I don’t even have a response.

Partly cuz if the guy doesn't get a clue when I reject him the first time, I get really confrontational thereafter until the fucker leaves... which ruins the mood of the actual date that's occurring.

hbo8i61,RedPillWomen,Interesting.     Thoughts on a woman who does the same?,"Women that go for guys with low body counts? I think it’s cool because a woman that wants a committed relationship needs a man that isn’t promiscuous. Sleeping with too many people is bad for either gender because it is detrimental to our abilities to bond with a partner. Plus there are really three types of non-promiscuous, ones that can’t get laid, ones that abstain for religion and ones that are too busy with eduction, work, friends and family to be able to sustain a high body count.

I took them back to the room where I saw 2 10-11 yo working and even in the way between saw another 13-14yo working.

In the past and especially recently men have become the ""nest makers"", somthing that has been traditionally held by women. Not to say women shouldn't be free to do as they please with there lives, that isnt what I'm saying at all but that because largely women have become completely separate from men and In a way they themselves have become (((men)))(the hunter gatherers) and men as a result lack  having the figurative sense of meaning that comes from providing for their family's and being the guardian of their home lives, men loose sight of what it actually means to be masculine in which they turn to the collection of commodities to fit what has been socially ingrained in their minds of what the ideal man ought to be, the white picket fence etc.... largely I believe out of some subconscious fear of being emasculated and fitting into the cookie cutter expectation of who they should be rather then who they want to be, they begin to  become socially alienated, projecting the strawman they built of themselves onto the world likely through modern means such as social media. Overall what I'm saying is men,regardless of race or sexuality really lack a purpose that purpose was once filled by the family life but now it is nihilism, posistions of economic and political power as shown historically have also been commodified as in the past women have been attracted to strong and powerful men. I'm not saying this is women's fault considering it really wasn't women who created this, women are individuals and can make their own choices but that this cultural shift that resulted in the masculinity crisis mentioned and described previously, this has actually been fantastic for capitalism  since capitalists now can sell off as many commodities as possible and doll out loans and other usury to keep the entire populace in slavery.

Trump has been a pretty solid investment for 24/7 drama thus far, I think 4 more years of seething + uncertainty over his 2024 replacement would be the best outcome. You get twice the drama from having two primaries to watch and holdover drama from Bernie being too old to run again.","> I really don't see Bernie winning though. Even the bongs voted for the guy with bad hair over the socialist, there's no chance the burgers wouldn't follow suit.    Eh, different situations. The multi party system over there splits the leftist and liberal vote, while over here it's combined into the Dem voting base with both the neolib and Sanders factions. The rightoid presence in the US is obviously bigger but combining the libs and lefties into one voting block means that the Dems have done better in most elections in the 21st century, barring the last presidential election of course.    I think what a lot of people seem to be overlooking is that nobody thought daddy would win and expected hilldawg to have the election in the bag. That as well as the fact that Bernie is better at riling up his base while most people who voted for hilldawg weren't overly enthusiastic about her, just ""I guess she's not Trump and I remember her getting cucked by Bil in the 90's"". That as well as the fact that the Dems won the midterms seems to indicate that daddy will be voted out.    Now the real asset for dramacoin is gonna be watching daddy refuse to concede the election, claiming it was rigged, chimping out 24/7 on twitter about it, maybe refusing to leave the white house and having to be physically dragged out by Secret Service on live TV.",0,reply_to_newcomer

d50pmt4,Gender_Critical,"This resonates with me because I also spent a few months in an inpatient treatment center for anorexia when I was 18, and I also hated being female when I was a teenager. I didn't make the connection at the time, but in hindsight I know part of it was an attempt to rid myself of my developing female body. I also liked the loss of menstruation that came along with starvation. It's interesting that the typical anorexic trope we hear involves girls striving for this feminine ideal, when I know many of us not only rejected our femininity, but also actively tried to starve it away. I see a lot of parallels between gender dysphoric girls and anorexic girls, I don't have time to get into it all now but it is definitely worth exploring.",">I see a lot of parallels between gender dysphoric girls and anorexic girls    Yeah, that's what I was thinking when I read it.

[The founding fathers of America were white nationalists before that phrase was even invented](http://historythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/usconstitution2.png). They wrote periodically of the [dangers of Jews](http://www.azquotes.com/picture-quotes/quote-they-the-jews-work-more-effectively-against-us-than-the-enemy-s-armies-they-are-a-hundred-george-washington-61-46-89.jpg) and were [""red-pilled""](http://smoloko.com/wp-content/uploads/BenFranklinJewsMeme7-1.jpg) on [Jewry](http://smoloko.com/wp-content/uploads/thomasJeffersonJewsMeme2.jpg) (again, before that phrase was even invented). It wasn't until the Jews started inundating the nation and subverting it, via their usual tricks, that the failure of the Founders to include safeguards against those PRIVATE subversions came to be known. But in their defense, there never was a need to adopt such ""radical"" measures against Jews because the entire nation was nothing but people of a single ideological homogenous ideology. White Christian Heterosexual males of strong moral values and convictions. If you read about the way certain Statesmen of the day considered the 10th Amendment (all powers not specifically granted the Federal Gov are reserved to the people and the states) [a ridiculous unnecessary waste of an Amendment](http://libertasutah.org/center-for-tenth-amendment-studies/the-tenth-a-superfluous-amendment/). Because ""Why the hell would we have to specifically spell that out? It's obvious it's what the entire Constitution is about"". Now we know better.     Policies of the NSDAP are a natural protective augment to the ideological  tenets of the Constitution. That all white free men are created equal and are endowed with certain unalienable rights by our creator. The key is that for the nation to remain ""free"", it must remain homogenous ideologically ---- which naturally implies racially as well by virtue of clear behavioral disparity between the races. in that manner, NSDAP policies are the immune system and safeguard of the healthy body that is/was the USA at the nation's founding.     Furthermore, personally I would also include/ensure societal paradigms that would allow a free people (NOT govt) to remove elements of a society it deemed 'subversive' and 'harmful'. The one failing of America is that there is no way to ""legally"" kill and remove the pieces of filth that have ideologically and culturally subverted us. Because the govt's police state has been created to protect the Jews and the Jew's Golems in various forms. Can't kill the teachers that want to teach your children that being white is bad and they should hate themselves. Can't kill the Jews that tell blacks that the white man is responsible for all their problems. Can't kill the faggots that openly fuck each other in faggot pride parades across the country. Can't kill the creators of ""piss Christ"" or others. Nope. Used to be you could -- and the police would turn a blind eye because they knew it was morally just and righteous. But not anymore --- these cancerous elements  are protected from retribution by the police. It's akin to the immune system protecting cancer cells from removal by other autonomic forces. And, as such, they are allowed to grow and metastasize into a cancer that spreads throughout the rest of the body, taking root and destroying institutions of the great nation that our forefathers fought so hard and bitterly to create and preserve. .

ehtmj3a,askanincel,"I had a raging crush on this one girl in high school. We had been 'friends' for years, we played soccer together as little kids. I liked her a lot then but she blossomed in HS and I decided to try and woo her. I asked her out in middle school once and she politely declined, that's fine. We remained 'friends' (whenever she needed homework help I was the coolest thing since sliced bread but not when she was around her cool friends). I decided to up my game and literally start baking stuff for her to show how good I would treat her. I always would take an interest and listen to her, be polite to her, show up to her sporting events when nobody else would, and I always would try to help her out with anything she needed. I caught alot of flak but it was fine because maybe she'd like me. She rejected me again freshmen year, fine again, she maybe wasn't looking for anything.    Sophomore year she gets this boyfriend who is a stereotypical douche. She was smitten and I think he took her virginity, idk though. About 3 months into their relationship they have a convo that went something like: ""have you been cheating on me?"" and then he sent a video of someone else giving him a BJ.    I hear about this and me being my supportive self texted her and let her know that I still cared about her even though she was mistreated, she actually responded nicely with a huge thank you and asked how I was. She was on a roadtrip so she was bored and wanted to talk to someone, that someone was me. We talked for hours about everything hopes, dreams, our favorite memories, etc..  I even propositioned that we do something together sometime and she said yes! She was going on a cruise so she wasn't going to be able to talk with me for a week or so, so I waited a week and a day or two(didn't want to be annoying) and texted her, no response. I texted the next day and 3 days after that with no reply. She didn't respond but I definitely got a message: I don't want you.    That story pretty much sums up that even when someone thinks I am smart, friendly, supportive, funny, and kind I am not enough.

dotln82,askseddit,"I personally don't have much experience, so take the weight of my opinion as you feel necessary:    You have a lot of potential based on your mentality, and that's ok because we all make and learn from our mistakes.     The first thing I noticed is that you seem to have a tendency to overanalyze a situation, and that's eating you up:    *""She suggested getting one room and I happily agreed. I figured she must have some sort of interest in me because she suggested one room.""*   It could mean that, it could also mean something logical such as saving money.    *""She posts a picture of me on her instagram (which I took as an increased level of interest).""*   Ask yourself this if you put up a picture of a friend of the opposite gender on Instagram, does that automatically mean you're in to her? I'll say that at the very least it shows she acknowledges you.    *""I texted her to make sure she got home and said I had a good time and we should go out again (needy, bitch ass behavior), but she agreed.""*   There's a fine line walked between showing interest and being needy. If anything you're qualifying saying you had fun with her, and you'd like to be with her more. Not to mention you waited 4 days, that's plenty of time/space given.    Anyway, I don't think that admitting you had feelings for her was a fuck up, especially since you had chemistry & already took her out at this point. You were showing signs of interest after all (you noted on the first date you made attempts to escalate physically). You went for it, and she didn't straight up blow you off. What's critical too is that you didn't get salty, and went back to having fun acting like nothing happened, that shows interest, not neediness. I do feel that going for the kiss the next day was the only screw up, but that's only because when you revealed your feelings you learned she was hesitant. Going for it wasn't a massive screw up, it just verified that she's not interested romantically.    The best thing to do is to move on and continue on with your life, and not get hung up on her. If she does have some interest in you she'll come back at some point since she knows you're interested.     Anyway best advice I can give is try not to overanalyze and just go with the flow, and you haven't projected massive neediness based off what you typed. If anything the best thing to take away from this experience is that rejection happens and while it isn't pleasant, the best you can do is keep improving who you are and move on.                      ","I really needed this and you have no idea how much clarity this has given me. I seemed to have projected my feelings on to her as noted by your excerpts.

cmfkuz5,ferguson,"After reading this post, I'm embarrassed to share your lack of pigment...    First, there is not a single person who would claim that it was your lack of pigment directly that inhibits the success of those who have alternative pigments. However the views that society has regarding the various pigments does inhibit people's success and it is a very serious issue. The fact that you took such a serious issue, redirected the blame to something ridiculous, and then tried to use sarcasm to throw the issue in the faces of those most hurt by the issue is low and disgusting.     Racism is not as prevalent as ever. We have come a long way from lawfully enslaving people. We have made a lot of improvement. However the issue is not over. Once the racism was taken out of our laws, it changed into a more subtle, hidden form. A good example was pointed out to me by one of the smartest men I ever met (and, I'm convinced, the smartest man I will ever meet in the neighborhood I live in). He said that he refuses to be called an ""African American"" because he was born in America, raised in America, and knows nothing at all about Africa. He is 100% American. You can call him black, because he is. But to call him ""African American"" implies that he is somehow a less pure American than I am, just because his skin is a different color. I had never thought of it before then, but he was able to see the real form racism takes in the modern world. All the higher-quality education that is more available to you because of your ""lack of pigment"", and you still aren't educated enough to see the more obvious examples of racism, much less the more subtle issues like that one that might just go by unnoticed for centuries to come. It's sad.    These benefits that you get for your ""lack of pigment"" leaves the black community at the low end of the economy, because we get first dibs at just about everything. This means they struggle to get their next meal. This means they have little or no health care, which leaves a lot of them to live in physical pain and sickness. This means they don't have time for things like education and maturity - the things that they need to be successful OUTSIDE of the ghetto where they are forced to live. They are stuck in a rut and their only way out is through drugs that take their mind off of their misery. Many of them live in such constant misery that they don't even realize how miserable they really are! What they do know is that it's a lot easier for people with your lack of pigment to get by in life. They also know that while the average white American is not personally ruining their lives, that same average white American sure isn't doing anything to help them, either. And if you have to pick someone to blame for the social views against those with darker skin, it sure isn't the people who have the darker skin. So who would you blame?    As a disclaimer, I will also add that there are definitely those people who don't even try. There are blacks who literally reap from the government, have kids so they can sit around and do drugs on the average American tax dollar. There are blacks who are ignorant and like it that way, who are criminals just to pass the time, who this-that-and-the-other-thing because no-good-reason-at-all. And those people are an embarrassment to the rest of the black community in a very similar way to how whites who get online and post ignorant shit about racism being ""clear and prevalent as it ever as"" and having ""a new target"", use sarcasm to twist a serious issue into a mockery and then use it to attack the people that the issue hurts the most, and then tell the BLACK community to stop being immature - that shit makes me embarrassed for MY race, too.","Fuck off.

cqv16fj,NationalSocialism,"Exactly how I feel; technocracy is the only viable form of state today, but the big difference between neo-NS and judeo-democracy, besides both necessarily being technocracies, is that in neo-NS only those who have contributed and physically, tangibly, visibly helped their people (through contributions in all spheres of life) are the ones who get to lead, because they have proven themselves, whereas in judeo-democracy, the leaders are parasites who became powerful through fractional reserve banking swindling, IE doing nothing to help the people at all and even harming them. Its both technically ""technocracy"" IE a small minority need to control the technology, but its completely the opposite. In NS the minority controlling the technology are the ones who built the technology, whereas in judeo-democracy, it is the ones who subverted the society","I also would like to add that it is the goal of National Socialists to educate and prepare our own people to be as great as possible. So that the whole mass of people will realize their individual potentials, so that they are then able to use their talents for the betterment of the people.  I don't want a group of elitist who think they are better than most of their folk, but a group of leaders who are determined to raise the level of their folk to the highest possible level.  In a NS society everyone would have to have helped the society through their work, but that alone does not qualify them to lead.  But it is simply the natural gifts of certain people that will be discovered and worked on by schools, which we should create a society where natural ability for leadership reaches its way to the top naturally.  I think we can look to all that  the Nazis accomplished in Germany as a model for what National Socialists today should strive for. For their respective race/cultures ",1,reply_to_newcomer

Does the specific example matter ?     Again it is not about protecting the feeling of the trans person, it is about the other person having their own sexual preference, and people deciding the trans has the right to ignore those and lie and outright dupe the other person.     You are essentially saying it is alright to dupe a person and deny them the right to withhold consent based on their sexual preference.     To make an example : imagine a blind person do not want to have sex with white skinned people, or blue eye folk or whatever detail she cannot see. Are you telling us it is already to lie to that blind person , abuse her inability to detect the lie, and fuck him/her in spite of his/her taste no matter how absurd those taste are to you ?

Then they turn on a dime and reject evolution as ""pseudo-science"" when it contradicts their views on race and gender.","I have yet to see ""liberals"" (as in mainstream politicians, rather than edgy teens on Tumblr) outright deny evolution. Rather, they dismiss many of the claims associated with ""scientific racism"" / ""racialism"" / ""race realism"" as having insufficient evidence. And this isn't just ""liberals"" doing it, many of these claims are rejected by the overall scientific community as well. Racial differences in IQ are a classic example of this. A lot of the ""evidence"" for racial IQ differences is extremely questionable, because it doesn't isolate race as the independent variable. Comparing the IQ scores of white teenagers in France with those of black teenagers in Uganda doesn't really say anything conclusive about the effect of race on intelligence, since there's too many other factors to isolate race as the sole or primary factor behind IQ differences. To narrow it down to race, you basically have to control for all of those other factors, which means having people of multiple races raised in the same culture, given the same education, raised with similar parenting styles, in similar social/economic classes, and so on. There's a few trans-racial adoption studies that manage to do this, but these are unfortunatly pretty much the only studies that provide any conclusive information on the relationship between intelligence and race.",2,reply_to_newcomer

fmhhn9d,TimPool,whither right or wrong I still think the video should come to light.    The support for this person is causing concern.  The comments look worse than a far far right debate.    > Tim Pool is not a typical scientist and no authority to speak for his government.

d9qevwt,pol,"But safe spaces and trigger warnings aren't in real life. Things happen at a moments notice, things that are bad, and out of your control. You don't get a warning that something uncomfortable is about to happen.    You should not be taught this in college. Not to cower in place. You should be taught how to deal with the unexpected. That adrenaline is ok, and that you can control it. When someone makes you uncomfortable, you keep your cool and learn how to strike back strategically. ","Of course you don't get trigger warnings or safe spaces in real life. But that's such an arbitrary distinction, we don't get lots of things in ""real life"" that we've grown accustomed to having because they improve our quality of life. That's how evolution works and society changes for the better, we adopt things we didn't have before that prove to be useful.    And trigger warnings aren't there for people who might just disagree with or be ""offended"" by the content being presented. They're there for people who've had to deal with traumatic experiences. Those who've dealt with sexual assault, domestic violence, military combat, etc... People like to frame these things like they're simply about comfort, and yeah entitled people on the left have certainly taken advantage of that to make these trigger warnings apply to them, but let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater.    And safe spaces exist everywhere. Growing up as a black person in a predominately white neighborhood I can tell you I was hardly ever able to be myself, say the things I wanted to say, or fully express myself for fear of going against what was commonly considered acceptable. It felt like I was half asleep my entire life until I finally moved away; I didn't realize how much I had censored myself until I was surrounded by like minded individuals who weren't afraid to name things about our society that make many people uncomfortable.",2,reply_to_newcomer
