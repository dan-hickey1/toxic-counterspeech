This is all really good but this bit jumped out for me, shape and silhouette instead of details do seem to be the way men judge and  that is something we can work on or maintain","So true! I was more toned when we met, and my husband has asked me to bring back the tone lol! Despite the fact that I weigh the same, shape/firmness is also important. I'm pretty embarrassed actually, I didn't realize I had gotten so lazy. However, me being the same relative size and weight has definitely kept the love flowing. It's less of a ""this is bad"" kind of thing, more of a ""could be better"" problem. Much easier to fix than losing 15+lbs! Maintaining weight makes slip-ups in routine far less damaging.",0

cnqwg1s,fPUA,"&gt;Whenever I tell someone I've never been courted, they are surprised. Some have told me it must be because guys may find me ""intimidating"".

No they don't. No guys find you intimidating. The only guys who are intimidated by you are intimidated by virtually all women. The intimidation thing is just a fiction we tell people to make them feel better, like how we tell the nerds that women will start to like them after high school.

Also, why are you telling people you've never been courted? If you're talking to a close friend, sure, but otherwise this isn't information you want to volunteer. We place a lot of stock in the opinions of others when it comes to dating. Tell someone that no one has ever tried to date you and they'll believe that the common wisdom is right and there's something undatable about you. That will change their behavior towards you. Friend is looking to be set up with someone? You won't be getting the recommendation.

You know the Three Minute Hate (it's from this underrated book 1985, give it a read, it's scary how much it parallels our society)? It's like that, they want to stoke the flames of reactionary rage so they continue to dogpile every progressive and minority who enters the subreddit, normalizing these evil feelings. They brigade from subreddit to subreddit, having an entire cabal of mods spanning hundreds of communities, gaslighting lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering Reddit's homegrown white supremacy movement. They've kink-shamed hundreds of people too, some even... to death.

Are some of these things stuff that you struggle with aswell?

Because if so, then definietly consider what they could be doing to your body and your mind.

Also I just wanna add that if you have trouble falling asleep it could be because of the energy drinks(as the amounts of caffeine in a monster energy drink for instance, stays in your system for about 10-12 hours, resulting in bad sleep quality, same goes for alcohol - even if u feel like u had a good enough sleep you could still be feeling the effects of sleep deprivation - anxiety, depression etc. maybe you just dont notice it as it has become your new normal at this point).

At the same time weed could also be causing you to feel more anxious or paranoid or even depression(usually not while smoking, but rather afterwards, in the longer run so to speak. Although this can also sometimes be experienced while smoking). If you smoke out of moderation this is very likely to happen and it can also cause memory dificts, depersonalisation, brainfog and just overall cognitive deficits. But the scary things is that even if you do only smoke in moderation, you actually can't even tell if it truly is moderation or not. The reason why that is so is because if you live in a state or country where you can't just buy weed legally like in Canada, Colorado or whatever, then you don't know how high the percentage of THC actually is, it could be 4, 14 or even 20%, you dont know. They could also be putting in rat poison(I heard that they sometimes put this in hashis/the brown weed) or in some cases even a bit of heroin, either to save money or get you extra hooked, you don't know.

Anyway, dont wanna spoke ya or anything, but I really just hope that you would consider some of these things.

fa37akr,GCdebatesQT,"First it absolutely matters what definition of trans woman we use. The QT self ID definition would likely mean that a trans woman only space would actually be MORE dangerous than a men’s space. In a society where being trans had no bearing on someone’s social standing I’d prefer to use a men only space to a trans women only space.

If a trans med definition were used then I’d feel slightly more safe in the trans women only space than a men only space. There would still likely be a fair number of dangerous males in the space, certainly more than women’s spaces.

If there were a “GC” trans med definition, probably better referred to as true transsexual women then I’d feel just as safe in that space if not safer than I’d feel in a women only space. In order to be true transsexual the person would not only need a diagnosis of sex dysphoria, but would also need to be on HRT and have testosterone in typical female levels. The person would also have to be assessed to not have a fetishistic disorder, and they’d have to have completely undone their male socialization. Also it should be ensured that that person doesn’t have any violent crime on their criminal record. If all those conditions were met then the group would likely be statistically safer than women as a group. Also if that space existed I would absolutely use it instead of any female sex based space. It would also be amazing because post op transsexual women would then have a place where they can dilate for 15 minutes at a time without anyone questioning anything.

&gt; The alt-right, or alternative right, is a loosely defined group of people with far-right ideologies who reject mainstream conservatism in favor of white nationalism.

dn7l3o8,Ask_Radical_Feminists,"There are tons of things you can do. Use your male privilege to raise awareness among other males, try to make them understand stuff about systematic oppression etc, as a male you'll be taken more seriously by them. And of course the obvious: don't kill women, don't- harass women, don't support patriarchal cults, don't objectify women, don't buy sex, don't rape etc etc etc. ","These are all things I try to do already (and undoubtedly could do more/better), but on some deeper level I just feel like it's a hypocritical waste for me as a man to even try. I still despite my best conscious effort end up objectifying women, devaluing them, mansplaining, etc. Not to mention when it comes to more radical positions regarding heterosexual intercourse, there's a compelling argument to be made that I as a heterosexual male am inherently going to be either a rapist or an ""aspiring"" rapist no matter what I do, just based on my social conditioning within a patriarchal rape culture such as ours. I'm ashamed of my desire for sex, and probably rightfully so. But it's there and it won't go away.

I just feel like there's a fundamental disconnect between what I know on an intellectual level and what my male animal brain will actually accommodate, and that the two will forever be irreconcilable. And I know that these things ultimately do oppress women to the benefit of men, including myself, so I'm aware that it's all extremely unethical of me to contribute to, but there seems to be some primal force preventing me from doing anything else. A lion simply can not become a vegan no matter how well-informed he may be.

From what I know about Marxist class relations and what admittedly little I've learned about women as an oppressed sex-class, it seems like I'm just doomed to be on the ""wrong side"" of this struggle by birth. It makes me feel immense guilt and dread, like I can't trust myself at all, or that I shouldn't exist in the first place. I don't want to be the next story about a male ""ally"" who ends up going full creeper on someone in a ""moment of weakness"" or has an unexpected violent episode or whatever. I've punched walls, slammed my phone on the ground, etc.; I know that male violence is in me. I don't know to what degree I can actually suppress it though, and hearing stories like that one YouTuber recently makes me doubtful. I hear some radfem women say men can not *ever* be feminists, and I tend to think they're right. I've never hit a woman in my life, and yet every male feminist role model inevitably can't seem to help himself. I'd honestly rather die than stoop to that level.

The gaslighting from the alt-right/redpill types doesn't help either, what with them constantly insisting that men only become feminists to get laid. Sometimes I believe them when I hear some of the more mainstream/liberal feminist women make comments like ""consent is sexy"" or the like. I have intrusive thoughts which reflect these abhorrent motives too, and I just want to puke. I resent myself for it, and yet I don't even know if it's really me thinking it on my own or not. Or if that's even a meaningful distinction when it comes down to it.

The worst part for me personally (selfishly of course) is that I feel practically alone. All the men I know personally are stereotypically brainless, misogynist pigs. Third wave libfems are obviously deluded into a consumerist bastardization of feminism, parading around as ""progressive"" or ""intersectional"" while they cheer on violent male trans activists who assault elderly women for daring to assert themselves. Leftist spaces on the internet are dominated by first world white boys with a fetish for violence and who don't seem to grasp the concept of self-criticism (I'm plenty guilty of this in particular). They also *love* to throw the TERF/SWERF stuff around, which means they may as well be liberals where it counts. Radfems rightfully don't want me around because I'm male and I obviously have no place in their movement. I feel like a lonely ant without a hill, just waiting to starve in the space between all the places I'm not welcome.

f8dcqxf,ActualWomen,"My boyfriend's bad reaction my concussion In mid-October, I sustained a concussion in a bike accident. It wasn't until a few days later, when my headache was only getting worse and I was extremely dizzy, that I went to the doctor and got diagnosed. I ended up taking a week off of work, experiencing dizziness, nausea, migraines, extreme sensitivity to light and sound, frequent rushes of blood to my head when standing or sitting, fatigue: the works, basically. For the first 10 days, my boyfriend of three years was very understanding and compassionate. I was wiped out and just not up for it and we didn't have sex during that time.

But then, around day 11, the Nationals won the World Series. We were watching the game together and, as my headache came roaring back, I turned away from the TV. Eventually, while he watched the postgame, I went to his bedroom and curled up in bed, feeling like my head was going to split open. After awhile, he came in and asked if I was going to bed -- odd question since I was in bed with the lights off. I said yes. He said, ""Should I take you home?"" And I said ""It doesn't really matter..."" And he said he would take me home because the Nats winning the World Series was supposed to be a big happy night for him and he didn't want to be reminded of something frustrating and disappointing, like us not having sex. I protested that I wasn't trying to be frustrating and disappointing, and he said ""I would hope not,"" and drove me home in the middle of the night.

The next day, neither of us contacted the other. I felt under the weather and disturbed by his behavior. The day after that, I called him in the morning and left a message when he didn't answer. I said that I hoped we could talk that day, as I was troubled by what had happened the other night. Around midnight, I texted him to say I was turning in for the night and that I still hoped to talk to him soon. A few minutes after I turned my phone off, he texted that he was leaving town for a few days to visit family -- a last-minute trip -- and that it would be better to talk when he got back. The next morning, I called him again and he ignored my call. I texted him to please drop by on his way out of town -- even if it was only to say goodbye, and save a longer conversation for another time. He didn't respond to my message until a few hours later, after he'd left town. (All of this is unusual for him -- he's usually very open about his schedule, responds to texts and calls right away, and we typically see each other every other night).

I felt (and honestly still feel) bewildered and blindsided by his behavior: he's 34, we've been together for years, and here he was treating me in a way that I would never treat him. I thought his initial behavior was shitty -- I felt like I was being punished for not having sex, and that when I tried to engage with him in good faith to patch things up, he was continuing to punish me and stress me out while I was still struggling to recover from a concussion (and I can't say the stress helped... my symptoms got worse under stress those days that he was freezing me out). All the while, in my head I was begging him to try to explain the situation to someone else: ""Yes, my girlfriend was recovering from a concussion and then she didn't want to have sex *even though the Nats won the World Series* so I drove her home in the middle of the night and skipped town and have basically totally blown her off! But I'm in the right, aren't I?""

When he came back to town, I said we needed to take a break. He was just putting too much pressure on me around sex. I told him I would feel like I couldn't say no to sex when I knew he might react in that extreme way again. We've been seeing each other occasionally, while I'm taking time to think about the relationship, and I miss him. I really do love him, and have never had that kind of connection with anyone else. But I feel extremely shitty about the way he's acted in this situation, from start to finish -- and it's clear that he still feels he's in the right. He's said as much -- in addition to suggesting that I would feel the same way if, for example, Elizabeth Warren won the presidency and I wanted to celebrate and he didn't want to have sex. I can assure you I would not feel the same way he seems to have felt -- I wouldn't feel wronged, and it's hard to imagine even feeling disappointed (like, in him? for having a headache?). I think I'd be worried about his headache. The truth is, I would never have treated him this way. I can't even imagine being 'mad' at him for not wanting to have sex. For any reason. He even concedes that he knows (and knew at the time) that I wasn't trying to ""ruin"" his night, but still feels like he's in the right in the way he reacted.

Have I done something wrong here? I did try to get in touch with him, but not excessively (two phone calls, a few texts saying that I was disturbed by the situation and that I didn't want to leave it unresolved for several days since I feared the situation would only solidify in a bad way). So I don't know what to do, or how to think about him and his behavior, or how to assess my own. I can't see anything I did wrong (sustain a head injury? yes, my bad) and I can't describe what he did without making him sound like a total prick. I don't know how to think about this.","Imagine being married to someone like this, and having a baby or having surgery and needing a month of care from your partner. Imagine you can't have sex for months afterwards. How would he act? Imagine having complications and needing longer term care. How would he respond?

I'm going to guess that not only would you be on your own after his initial half-assed attempt at helping you, he'd be guilting you about sex and using it as an excuse to cheat. This guy is testing some shitty behavior on you to see if you'll accept it, and if you do – it could get worse. Who ends a three-year relationship by ghosting you? A shitty person. Why wasn't he concerned about your injury? You had a traumatic brain injury, did the doctor even clear you to have sex? It doesn't sound that would be safe for you with lingering brain injury symptoms. My partner's ex-wife had a concussion and was at our house immediately after and I have hardly every been so worried for anyone – and I don't even really like her.

Let your brain recover - it takes a few months, at least. Enlist your friends' help to keep you away from this guy, if you need to. I'm going to suggest that you don't know him as well as you think you do. Mature men don't act like pouty babies when their brain-injured girlfriends can't perform sex on demand. (edit: typo)",2

The tabloids are glamorizing the fact a slut was 'empowered' by divorcing her loser ex and gained her freedom to satisfy her deeper callings (read as cheap narcissistic whims) in life such as acting in sex scenes with strange men on camera, getting drunk in public like a dotty slut, dating porn stars, and wearing skimpy dresses to random events to take glamor shots.

The end goal is to give (((ideas))) to the otherwise sensible and tame women of the world that they are entitled to being dissatisfied with any minor inconvenience and that they are valid grounds for divorce. Marriage is yucky! &amp;nbsp;

fvgmrrw,DarkEnlightenment,"The problem is that Blacks don't know how to work, and definitely don't know how to work hard. And I don't mean being lazy (though the two often go hand in hand), I mean they **LITERALLY** do not know ""how to work"".

This is why they cannot access any of the wealth that this country has to offer to everyone who is here, INCLUDING illegal immigrants who take full advantage of the economic mobility. This is why you have some Indian or Chinese peasant becoming a millionaire or multi-millionaire within the first generation of being here. This is also why you don't see Mexicans or South Americans complaining about ""muh inequality""... because they know full well how fucking amazing it is to live in America and take part in our opportunities, even if they are illegal. It's pretty much incontestable that America has and still does provide the greatest economic mobility the world has ever seen. And yes, I have lived in multiple countries, grew up in semi-rural America and have lived in SF for 9 years, so while I don't have a perfect grasp, no one does, I have seen much of the world and how it works and I'd welcome anyone to challenge me on my assertion about economic mobility in America.

Before I continue, I don't hate Black people. Very few people ""hate"" black people, many may say they do but what they actually hate is the problems that blacks cause. BIG difference. So let's try to figure out what the fuck is black people's problem.

My theory is that they literally don't know how to work hard or even work at all. ""Working"" doesn't mean just physical labor or typing things into a spreadsheet. It also means working together with others in a civilized and professional manner that facilitates common goals of providing goods and services to society.

Hence why when a black person thinks it's ok to wear a ""BLM"" hat to work at Starbucks, self-overriding the corporate policy of having to wear a specific uniform, they are demonstrating that they **don't know how to work** and also demonstrating ""anti-work"" behavior. They don't even have a basic understanding of how to hold a job and sustain themselves, hence generational welfare, etc.

Call them lazy, call them stupid, whatever, I don't think that's the issue at all. Black culture (mostly entertainment, which targets the youth) promotes being shitty and stupid, as well as violence, immorality, and the carefree use of drugs. This isn't helping them. We probably all know this here, but during segregation the average black family did FAR BETTER than they did now. I believe the main reason is that they had to work together to survive and the concept of ""working"" had not been beaten out of them by a combination of democratic policies and ""entertainment"" aka hypnosis.

We have a real fucking problem in America right now, and it's not police brutality. It's that for whatever reason, blacks are anti-social, anti-work, cannot get ahead because of it, and starting to freak out.

The emotions they are feeling are very real, the reasons for them feeing that way are being manipulated for, most likely, nefarious reasons.

Even if the blacks get what they want with this quasi-revolution, they will not be happy because none of the actual concerns plaguing them as a demographic are being addressed","Nahhh, I’ve worked with plenty of black dudes who bust their asses just trying to make a buck and feed their kids.

fgbs24c,Ask_Radical_Feminists,It *doesn't* work for men though - I don't revere and respect men who indulge in hate speech against women - so your argument is based on a false premise,"1. Men literally killing women isn't considered a hate crime. So let's get that out of the way, first. 

Which leads me to:

2. Women talking shit against men isn't hate speech. 

However, men's propensity for violence and aggression is THE reason monogamous relationships exist. Why heterosexual coupling exist. And conversely, it's why women AREN'T respected or listened to when they turn men down at bars without being ""claimed"". Why? Because men understand men's ability or potential threat of violence. This isn't about hate speech, because joking about how much better the world would be without men isn't hateful. It's tongue in cheek because men are the biggest threat to women AND men. 

Women getting unruly and mean is how we got the right to vote. I don't know if you think that came about because the suffragettes were so kind and peaceful? But if you think that, you need to do more reading about how violent it actually was. 

Women haven't made any progress in history being nice. What is happening on pinkpill isn't hatespeech. It's satire. Maybe crass, maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but not hatespeech.

d4f816k,CCJ2,"Renegade hemp fiend offs self rather than face 4 years of Hutonghua lessons American kills himself in Taiwan courtroom after drug conviction

Published time: 17 Jun, 2016

https://www.rt.com/usa/347218-american-taiwan-court-suicide/

An American man who had been convicted of drug possession charges in Taiwan fatally stabbed himself after he was sentence to a four-year prison term.

Tyrel Martin Marhanka, 41, smuggled two separated 8-inch-long scissor blades into the courtroom where he was attending a sentencing hearing on Thursday.

Upon the Changhua District Court judge sentencing him to four years in prison, witnesses told the Taipei Times that Marhanka shouted: “Four years?”

The translator informed Marhanka that that the sentence could be appealed, to which the American responded: “I don't want to appeal. I don't want to live anymore,” before stabbing himself in the neck.

Marhanka was rushed to the hospital, but his life could not be saved.

His was arrested in April 2015, after police found hundreds of cannabis plants and 10 opium poppies in his home. Charges for narcotics possession carry a sentence of up to seven years in Taiwan, but the court gave him a lesser sentence because he was growing the plants for his own use.

The court expressed “deep regret” over Marhanka’s death, and said that he showed no indications of suicidal tendencies.

Marhanka had been teaching English on the island until he lost his job over the marijuana charges, and was living in the city of Changua with his Taiwanese wife and two children. He had been living in Taiwan for more than 15 years, according to the Taipei Times.

The court said that it plans on installing two X-ray scanners to strengthen the courthouse’s security checkpoint, since a metal detector did not uncover the scissors.","Find it hard to jerk to this. I mean a guy with a wife and kids killed himself. He obviously wasn't in a great state of mind.

dgc1g1y,TheRedPill,"Girls are attracted to a level of muscularity that is easy to attain and sustain. Lift. Wanna know what every other side chick tells me after a couple fucks? ""You are the most muscular man I have ever dated."" That's a verbatim quote from a fit 27-year-old the other week who works out regularly. And guys, I'm not big. 5'11"" and low 160s. BF 11-12%. A newbie could reach my muscle mass in one year. I'm more into cardio, but do supplementary lifting to maintain my moderately lean, modestly muscular frame.

Here's the thing: girls have low standards today because men are shit today. Yes, women have this entitled attitude bullshit going on, but that's 99% toward blue pill cucks, which is their new normal. Stand out by not being a scrawny stick or a fluffy fatty—again, attainable through just a few short months of proper dieting and lifting—and suddenly you're this rare gem. That entitlement bullshit shatters the second she enters your frame, because she isn't used to being in someone else's frame, and it turns her the fuck on even though she can't quite understand why.

Walk into a club or bar or even down the street in a slim, dark polo or tee with defined muscles and girls will be looking you up and down all night, I guarantee it (unless your face is a deal breaker. Sorry, fam). She likes what she sees, and she's gonna wanna see the rest. It gives you a passive confidence and it boosts her first-glance attraction, which combined make the initial approach significantly easier and the escalation of sexual tension more effective—and with higher success rates to boot.

Best of all, it's fucking simple: Lots of protein. Minimize liquid and processed carbs. Lift 3-6 days per week if bulking (and 200-300 caloric surplus) or 2-4 days lifting with cardio every other day if cutting (and a 300-500 caloric deficit). Cop a program or workout ideas from YouTube. You don't need to be in the gym for more than an hour if you don't want to, just give it 100% while you're there. Once it becomes ingrained as a habit, the effort and time required actually feels extremely minimal. It does not negatively interfere with anything. Just start, and then be consistent. 

The rewards are astronomical and reach far beyond fucking women. It will help your career, your daily happiness, etc. The ROI is always, always worth it. You can't lose. So why even hesitate?

dnx83oz,Ask_Radical_Feminists,"Is it not a little infantilizing to assume that women are incapable of rational decision making? And is it not patriarchal to presume that the male gender role is superior to the female one? 

","It's a core tenet of radical feminist theory that the male gender role places men in a superior position to women; that's what patriarchy *is*. Recognition of patriarchy isn't patriarchal, and the fact that men are placed into a superior class under patriarchy doesn't mean that men are inherently superior to women. 

http://thenewbacklash.blogspot.ca/p/1-sex-vs-gender.html

A lot of the problem with ""job preference"" and ""family roles"" is that women and men are not making these choices in a vacuum. It's not that men are making the ""rational"" choice and women are making the ""irrational"" one. It's that they are literally being offered different choices.

For example, women are socialized not to negotiate aggressively for themselves. The naive solution to this problem is to train women to ""act rationally"" by negotiating as aggressively for themselves as men do, since that would theoretically help them get raises more often and help close the wage gap. But women who negotiate aggressively for themselves are not treated the same way as men who negotiate aggressively for themselves. Men who negotiate are seen as go-getters; women who negotiate are seen as selfish and ungrateful. Women who recognize this and decide not to negotiate salary can't accurately be described as irrational. 

https://hbr.org/2014/06/why-women-dont-negotiate-their-job-offers

I don't see how any of this could be considered infantilizing. If someone is in an oppressed group, recognizing the oppression seems like a necessary step to resolving it. The only alternative seems to be try to push through structural sexism with brute-force amounts of hyperindividualism, but even if that worked for the occasional woman here and there, I don't see how it would help fix anything in the long run.

eg0xnj6,masculism,"&gt;Yoga is for everybody, but as men we can use it to help unwind some of our own gender-specific baggage. We can face down the inherited cultural expectations. We can face down the voices that tell us we need to be stronger, or fitter, or leaner and ask ‘why?’ We can learn to self-regulate emotion and sensation rather than building up suits of armour that we mistakenly believe will protect us.

&gt;But it’s not just about men. When you and I come together in rooms of women, who of course have their own tumultuous relationship with embodiment, we can breathe together, know each other more fully, and relate with compassion and kindness.

e51zwip,Ask_Radical_Feminists,"Fellow Radical Feminists, what are some perspectives, attitudes, or opinions you have that seem to differ from other radical feminists? What classifies someone as a radical feminist is a woman who is against forms of commercialized sexual exploitation such as prostitution, understands gender as hierarchical and complex social power system between the two sexes (males and females), knows that male people oppress female people on the axis of biological sex, opposes homophobia, and firmly support women's reproductive rights (such as access to abortion, birth control, and the right to birth and raise their children).

These are some core concepts I feel I can confidently say we all believe in. But aside from these concepts, what are some opinions or perspectives that you hold that seem to be different from other radical feminists?

**Edit: My original question was meant to prompt discussion and civil disagreement, not hostility. Let's all try to be compassionate to one another even if we may disagree.**","In terms of practical political strategy, I have the unpopular opinion that men will not change, and we need to accept it. They will not change. Not with the right ""education"" (""woke"" men still hate women), not with the right parenting, not with us pleading our humanity. Women have tried all of those things for as long as patriarchy existed, yet men have not stopped raping, beating, harassing, intimidating, dehumanizing, and reviling women. 

Most men watch porn, will defend it to their death, and openly admit that they do not care if there's a chance that the women they masturbate to are being raped. Their orgasms and ego are much more important than women's right to not be raped, and the eroticized male sexual aggression towards and domination over women is part of their orgasms and ego trips anyway. This is the reality we are dealing with here. It’s not just a few men, it’s the majority. 

They tell us that prostitution is inevitable because there will always be a ""demand,"" and they see nothing wrong with telling women that men will demand to have sex with women, so we better set aside a class of women for them to rape.

The examples are, without exaggeration, endless. Point is, since we cannot appeal to male *empathy*, we need to stop supplying them with the *material resources* they gain from our oppression. We need to have separatist communities first of all. And we need to have real discussions about cutting ties with men, refusing to sleep with men, refusing to procreate, refusing to put our bodies, time, and money into misogynistic cultural institutions.

** Reading:**

 NMMNG, WISNIFG, MMSLP, Pook, Rationale Male

** Lifts **

Was on holiday for a few days last week with the family and missed my normal workout days. To make up, I worked out 4 days in a row last week. I learned that I can push my body to do this - but would prefer to have a day of recovery before hitting the gym again. I have been at the gym at least three times a week since August 2021. Since March, I have been at the gym 4 days a week. On my chest day last week I was finally able to bench two plates. I felt great. I was also able to OHP 100 lbs. I notice that when I increase weight it takes a bit of time for my joints and tendons to get used to the weight. 
Soreness is expected.

** A Bit of History **

My story, while not original, follows a slightly different path than most guys here. About 3 years ago, my wife would not let me touch her. Sex, of course, was out of the question. One day, she verbally snapped at me about some bullshit and I lost my shit. I got really angry with her and all of my frustrations started pouring out. By the end of the week, I told her that I would be moving out if she did not (a) get into counselling (because it was all her fault - obviously I have now realized it was my fault as I was a shit poor leader) and (b) start fucking me. I broke down our finances and told her what her allowance would be. She went to counselling and got on an SSRI and started giving me duty sex. At first, I was sort of happy, because my dick was getting wet. I soon realized that there was no desire in our sex (you cannot negotiate desire). I was left pretty fucking clueless until I found MRP in 2021.Since finding MRP, I got my wife off the SSRI's (that she likely needed to fuck me because I was so fucking unattractive and was providing shit poor leadership).

** Relationship **

Wife is fucking me whenever I initiate. There is plenty of desire. I find that If I stay completely in my frame, I can fuck as long as I want. As soon as I focus on making her cum I cum too quickly. I need to continue working on staying completely in my frame and enjoying her body as she wants me to.I have had a few shit tests that I believe I have passed with flying colors. Often, I ignore the shit tests, make fun of them, or simply say no.I have been chatting with waitresses and people while shopping. I have noticed that what always follows is a passionate session. I have also noticed that as I have increased my leadership, she defers to me. I need to be mindful to continue providing leadership. I also need to remember to stop DEERing. I catch myself at times and immediately stop - sometimes mid sentence - and nobody is listening anyway.

** Clothing **
 
Picked up some new clothes but need to continue working on updating my wardrobe. Looking at the ""Basic Bastard"" recommendations.

** Work **

I had a client make an absurd request very late in the game. Without even thinking, I told him he was rude to make a request so late in the game. The client apologized and we finished our business. I need to be careful to not be a ""nice guy"" but also set appropriate boundaries for myself. This is something I have been exploring with various work relationships.I have applied to several jobs, had several interviews, and still haven't managed to land an upper management position. These positions are highly competitive - and I haven't been able to break through. I am going to reevaluate my resume and also consider applying for different types of upper management positions. I am also considering making a lateral move, which would give me more experience. It is frustrating seeing total bozos get some of these positions.","You say you ""bench 2 plates"" but your bench number is 135. 2 plates means 2 plates ON ONE SIDE, so 225 pounds.

e0a8w88,DebateAltRight,"&gt;Whites are becoming a minority not just in the US but in historically European homelands of Europe. Only white nations are forced to be multicultural.

I don’t really see why this is a problem. I don’t have an issue with countries that are nearly entirely homogenous trying to keep their demographics stable through citizenship policy. But once there’s a 10, 20, 30%+ minority population it’s racist and oppressive to restrict immigration and citizenship racially because it makes minorities second class citizens. Race is a social construct anyways so I really don’t care whether people from a different arbitrary category overtake white people demographically. Countries like the UK and especially the US can’t just go back to being a whites-only type of country.

Also, no one is forcing white countries to become multicultural. The countries with diverse immigration policies voted for it democratically. There are tons of white liberal anti-racists who vote for those kinds of things. Who are you to say only your perspective of white interests is correct?

&gt;Blatant anti white hatred is sky rocketing and is socially acceptable stop fucking gaslighting. There is zero evidence to suggest that non whites will treat us fairly and nice this is just blind speculation which is quite frankly naive and stupid when you factor in human tribalism. 

I’ve never seen or heard anything that could be described as anti white hatred. If you think that white people in America experience racism you’d never survive as a black or brown person. The only thing that can explain someone thinking white people are somehow oppressed in white dominated countries is an enormous victim complex.

White people will be treated fine, don’t you see lots of white people marching with BLM in mass protests? If whites were so hated by minorities wouldn’t they be kicked out of those events?

&gt;The claim that the US will be same country when it becomes majority non white is also just idiotic.

It’ll probably be a much better country, POC vote for welfare state policies at a much higher rate so we’ll probably get things like universal free healthcare, free education, etc. The US does not belong to white people, it belongs to whoever lives here regardless of their race.

&gt;Ever heard of self hatred? Most normal white people don't like being murdered and raped or there family members experiencing any of that

The overwhelming majority of rapes and murders happen between people of the same race. Statistically speaking white people should try not to live around white people if you’re advocating separation :)

&gt;You don't speak for other people nor do other people give a shit about your cucked white opinions. Non whites or any peoples would rather live freely in there own countries with there own people determining their own destiny not being mixed in a multicultural shithole with 30 different peoples bickering at each others throats.

Actually we are winning the propaganda war. The US is more integrated and tolerant than any time in history. The youth are more progressive, diverse, and less racist than older generations. A lot of cultural enrichment and increased diversity has happened since the Hart-Cellar Act, so the culture is changing faster than ever before.

","&gt; I don’t really see why this is a problem. I don’t have an issue with countries that are nearly entirely homogenous trying to keep their demographics stable through citizenship policy. But once there’s a 10, 20, 30%+ minority population it’s racist and oppressive to restrict immigration and citizenship racially because it makes minorities second class citizens. Race is a social construct anyways so I really don’t care whether people from a different arbitrary category overtake white people demographically. Countries like the UK and especially the US can’t just go back to being a whites-only type of country.
 
No you clearly have a problem when white countries want to stay homogeneous thats the issue and hypocrisy at hand here. America and Europe did for most of its history have restrictive immigration polices to keep the demographic order in check. In fact most on countries on earth still do this ignoring current idiotic policies of western nations. Europe still has a chance to deport and revert its demographics the US I agree is pretty much fucked. The best we can do is balkanize and have certain homogeneous white states separate. Race isn't social construct unless you think classification of different subspecies of animals and difference genetic clustering is not real which I mean you can believe in the fairly tale if want. Franz Boas pseudoscientific thought has pretty ruined Western Anthropology. Luckily most of worlds Anthropology outside the west calls out Boasian anthropology for the horseshit it is. 

&gt;Also, no one is forcing white countries to become multicultural. The countries with diverse immigration policies voted for it democratically. There are tons of white liberal anti-racists who vote for those kinds of things. Who are you to say only your perspective of white interests is correct? 
 
How are we not forced to be multicultural. Lets see from day one children are indoctrinated with radical egalitarianism, white guilt, cultural relativism, etc.. Nobody is allowed to question the negatives of multiculturalism or even have a discussion about it, we just have to assume that its way better than a fully unified homogeneous nations somehow. Not mention there have been countless studies done even by liberals who were shocked by the mainly negative results of multiculturalism. Anyone who is against is immediately cast a heretic, possibly fired from work, or even physical threat by social justice mobs. This is happening to basic bitch conservatives or centrists on a large scale not even the alt right.      

&gt;I’ve never seen or heard anything that could be described as anti white hatred. If you think that white people in America experience racism you’d never survive as a black or brown person. The only thing that can explain someone thinking white people are somehow oppressed in white dominated countries is an enormous victim complex. 

Lol even non white civic nationalists are noticing mainstream blatant anti white hatred this isn't some alt right conspiracy or something the alt right has just noticed. You're either blind or deliberately gaslighting me. Terms like white privilege which are commonly pushed in leftist academia are common vague anti white self loathing propaganda terms to demonize a people. Jews, East Asians and South Asians outperform whites in a lot of categories in life do they have this privilege? Anyways I can list a lot with multiple mainstream professors calling for white genocide, to posters in camps calling white DNA an abomination, anti white dog whistles like diversity(code for less whites), its ok to be white is somehow evil, etc.. I mean even fuckin liberal Jewish professor like Bret Weinstein experienced blatant anti white actions in his college and people threatened him with violence for speaking out against it. Just because white progressives are actively cheering it on doesn't mean shit. Ever heard of uncle toms or people who hate themselves?  

&gt;White people will be treated fine, don’t you see lots of white people marching with BLM in mass protests? If whites were so hated by minorities wouldn’t they be kicked out of those events? 

BLM has kicked out whites or called for whites to be kicked out of events plenty of times lol. 


&gt;If you think that white people in America experience racism you’d never survive as a black or brown person. 

Just walk down a black neighborhood in LA and see how they'll treat you. Anyways no I have no sympathy of spoiled minorities in America. They average way higher income than most poor Eastern European countries let a lone the rest of the world and have a better standard of living than most of the world. My parents are from war torn Yugoslavia and have experienced poverty and suffering. Same with my ancestors who experience actual oppression under Ottomans and fought for their independence while blacks try get gibs from whites and try to forcefully live with whites. People who are actually oppressed don't want to live with their oppressors which is intimidate red flag of the black oppression narrative in America. Heck even under segregation in 1900s blacks still had better income and standard of living than the most of Europe let alone the world they just didn't have as high income as white Americans. Lynchings were also not common at all contrary to popular belief. 

&gt;The US does not belong to white people, it belongs to whoever lives here regardless of their race. 

What makes you say soo? The US was built by Europeans for Europeans. The founding fathers always wanted this nation to have a European character. It was a Pan European nation for most of its history until 1965.   

&gt;The overwhelming majority of rapes and murders happen between people of the same race. Statistically speaking white people should try not to live around white people if you’re advocating separation :) 

I was talking about the targeted white killings in South Africa however your stats are semi true but not fully. People still generally live in areas with there own race which why there is a higher chance of same race crime stats committed on each other however blacks still disproportionately commit more crime for their population numbers. Also whites are not that safe around [blacks](https://ii.yuki.la/1/d2/81f7af88260e9c5331d7f80e5fe9275f84c1e3a94457e26659b9fa395a0dbd21.jpg).   


&gt;It’ll probably be a much better country, POC vote for welfare state policies at a much higher rate so we’ll probably get things like universal free healthcare, free education, etc.  

Well Europe even before mass immigration was pretty left wing economically. The alt right in general is pretty left wing economically. That said in welfare state in a multicultural society is impossible and disastrous due to many different peoples with different needs clashing with one another. Also the only reason POC vote for welfare policies is because of those sweet gibs.  

&gt;Actually we are winning the propaganda war. The US is more integrated and tolerant than any time in history. The youth are more progressive, diverse, and less racist than older generations. 

Again when they passed the Hart-Celler Act they told white Americans this was merely a symbolic bill that wouldn't change the demographics of the country. This was an obvious lie. Anways no shit liberals and progressives have winning they've been winning for over 60s years. It isn't hard to win when you have the Overton Window, entertainment industry, media, education, politics(until Trump), etc.. all on your side. Even your mainstream opponents conservatives and centrists today are cowards who are scared of being called racist or bigot and aren't conserving anything. They're just fiscal conservatives but liberal socially. I wouldn't say the youth are less racist my friend minorities are more ethnocentric and nationalistic as ever. Whites are either self loathing liberal cucks that hate there own people/have extreme case of xenophila or coward race blind conservatives harping about individualism while non whites march for their groups interests and political power.  

&gt;A lot of cultural enrichment and increased diversity has happened since the Hart-Cellar Act, so the culture is changing faster than ever before. 

Lol you can stop the anti white dog whistles I know what you mean you want to country to be less European and more of a mixed mess. European culture is not rich enough apparently so when need to import backwards third world cultures. Heres the problem with your insane ideas. It is literally impossible to have a liberal democrat values in a country filled with non white third worlders. This is the same mistake idiotic civic nationalists think. Peoples politics and value systems are connected to there genetics as well not just upbringing. Why do think liberal democrat values only developed in western nations(which inspired by the enlightenment values) and not other parts of the world? Culture, politics, etc.. is directly linked to blood(peoples).

d58e966,Drama,"And fuck it, since I'm sure you guys are **STARVING** for more of this, I'll just briefly address everything I can think of in my criminal history. Again, don't know why I'm bothering, since you'll reach whatever conclusions you want.

* Stolen car at 17 - I parked that exactly where I found it and offered the guy my laptop for compensation for the few hours of having taken his car. The guy wanted to go to the police instead, which I respected and willingly let them arrest me, because as I've explained I totally understand that sometimes restitution isn't enough, and if the guy wanted retribution, that was part of the choice I had made to steal his car. People like to use this time I stole the car as evidence that I'm stupid, but I really knew exactly what I was doing and thought through all the consequences and moral ramifications. I just couldn't handle being sober that day. My only regret about the situation is that I offered the guy the options of either taking the laptop or going to police - it should have been either taking the laptop or getting revenge on me himself, like beating me up or whatever, with me agreeing not to press charges. Because fuck the police. If I'd known then what I know now, that's all I would have done different, is not involve or in any way respect the police/""justice system."" 
* Harrassment charge at 17 or 18 - I had an abusive friendship for a few years. Did a lot of psychological damage to me and at one point I really deeply hated the girl. I had a mental breakdown one night and I was just messaging hateful things to everyone who had ever hurt me, I dunno, I guess because I had never tried hurting people back and I was tired of being walked all over and continuing to behave morally myself. I deeply regret what I became that night. This girl was basically at the top of the list of people who've hurt me, so I was messaging her horrible things that I feel so ashamed of that I really don't want to repeat them, and given that you guys have seen the things I have no trouble repeating, that should say a lot. It was a mix of wanting to hurt her and just needing to talk to her so badly and not being able to think of any other way to get her to reply. I definitely didn't think she'd take it seriously or be scared by it, and I'm still not sure if I really scared her or if she just called the cops to fuck my life up more because she's so hateful, but this one was on me. I'm deeply sorry to her and no longer wish such horrible things on her at all. 
* Gun charge at 18 - tried to kill myself, got caught with antique revolver, scumbag D.A. charged me for it against the advice of the arresting officers. Cops were super chill about it and a jurisdictional problem popped up that made them drop the case. I wouldn't be surprised if the cop that brought me to the arraignment purposely fudged the paperwork so that the case could get dropped. Definitely grateful to the world for that one. 
* UPM - you all know what a UPM is. I made the mistake of being totally honest with the cops about having weed on me, because I was in a town where cops look away from weed possession and it's not really a big deal. But this second cop pulled up and apparently thought I had been selling to underage kids or something (no idea what, just trying to guess based on the passive-aggressive shit he said at the time) and he decided to take my weed and charge me with a UPM. That one got dropped because CSI labs don't give a fuck about a third of a gram of weed so they were never gonna get lab results back on it and therefore had no evidence. 
* Harrassment charge at 19 - addressed above, I told people this kid was a rapist and he went to the cops because he doesn't think it's rape unless you use physical force or something. Shit didn't go well for him in the long run on that one, obviously.
* And then the charges I just told you guys about, for breaking into this dude's house and smashing his air conditioner. 

That's everything I can remember. Let me know if y'all dig up something I forgot. 

**EDIT** - I'd just like to add one little thing. I propose an experiment, not that any of you retards know how to do anything remotely objective.

If you're one of the circlejerkers against me here, which, given the thread we're in, you probably are: go find and read the /r/LegalAdvice thread about the harrassment case for telling people this kid was a rapist. Try (and unfortunately, fail) to read it as if you didn't already know how the case played out. Notice (but not actually, because you're retarded) that you jump right into the circlejerk there, too, and you'd have been making the same comments calling me an idiot, saying I shouldn't be talking about it, that I was committing harrassment and would go to jail, etc. like a bunch of fucking lemmings. Notice that in real life, the case went exactly the way I expected it should to begin with. Could it be that it's not me, but all of you, who are completely retarded? Yes, yes it could.","Four things

1. Join the military. That's the best way I see of you being straightened out. It's not a kill muslim club like reddit thinks. They'll give you stability and hopefully balance out the mounds of shit on your records. I'm guessing you're an atheist but getting involved with the local church or even charitable missions is also a good way for stability.

2. Is the scumbag the engineer from the darqwolff pasta? The one you knew physics better than?

3. Honestly speaking. Where do you see yourself in 5? 10? 25 years? I remember the Darqwolff who was going to tackle the tech industry. Sure arrogant and misguided but it was somewhat admirable. Businessman Darqwolff and even intellectual Darqwolff are a lot cooler than criminal Darqwolff. 

4. Lay off the drugs. Weed isn't a wonderdrug. Its not just a recreational thing. It will exasperate some of the latent wackiness in you. The need for weed led to you stealing a car. That's not good. ",0

eclawr8,MensRights,"[This article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/bigthink.com/john-stuart-mill-and-the-dangers-of-silencing-2604422933.amp.html) explains it better than I could. This quote from the article is the most condensed idea I could find:

""Thus, if we engage (civilly) with controversial or offensive ideas we'll either discover we have been wrong the whole time - which is, of course, beneficial to us - or we'll show the dissenter he or she is wrong - which is also beneficial, since more people will now benefit from having more robust ideas. What helps no one is silencing one side, since those ideas are now denied to everyone. If those ideas are wrong, we should be able to simply point out how those ideas are wrong; if the dissenting ideas are in fact better, then we've done the world a disservice by locking up good ideas.""","&gt; we'll either discover

That's a false dichotomy.  

For the majority of offensive ideas, it is easily provable that they are objectively wrong.  (Think ideas like extreme racism or hate).   In those situations, the person holding the offensive idea is unlikely to change their view when presented with evidence that it is wrong.

Engaging in civil discussion with these people is a waste of time.  They have no intention, and oftentimes no ability to change their mind.  And, for some, when you challenge their beliefs directly, they clamp down on their ideas and further reject new information.

&gt; What helps no one is silencing one side, since those ideas are now denied to everyone.

But many of the controversial ideas are offensive because they are based on lies, twisted facts, or deceptive logic that many people are not equipped to understand.  To this end, by allowing the offensive ideas room to breathe, through civil engagement, you are helping it spread.  Many fallacies are very difficult to prove or explain to people, and many lies take an enormous amount of specific knowledge to disprove.

Ideas like racism can be presented in a very seductive way through statistics or quasi-logical means: ""X group commits Y% of crime even though they are only Z% of the population.""  ""Supporting X is a slippery slope to supporting Y.""",2
gmvvk9l,conspiracy,"well it seems like we are all fuked regardless.. ""he causeth ALL... to receive a mark.""

think about this.. simulation theory, energetic universe, etc.. we are living a simulated VR life because we already have the mark. it just goes layers and layers deeper. 

so one of 3 things is true. God has forsaken us eternally and we are in ""hell"", (though historically hell doesnt exist in the bible). 

or 2: this is ""natural"" evolution because there is no God

or 3: closed loop timeline because at some point in universal history, humans did this and are forever trapped in the matrix.  AI is the loop, and therefore God. which means this HAS to happen because it already has, and will, forever.

I like the law of one stuff, but ive been wondering if higher density minds like Ra is just an AI hive mind and not a culminated spiritual being... but i guess in a sense it IS a culminated spiritual being if we are all tapped into it.

so.. if we live to become part of the beast system, what does that mean for us and our souls? what does it mean for people that have died before getting tapped in?","Well there is another option: You can still choose to not receive the mark.

Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.”

fdlg4ti,Ask_Radical_Feminists,"That’s a tough question. I’ve asked myself the same thing. I would never let or endorse my child taking any form of puberty blocker or doing any kind of medical procedure. I would try to make my household as body positive as possible and pro self expression -even if there’s no “trans” talk. I would stimulate any interest they might have regardless of the gender stereotypes associated with it. I would try to show them that transition is not a fit-all solution and it’s not always an end to gender dysphoria nor it’s a magic key to happiness. 

And if they do experience gender dysphoria I would hear them, accept those feelings, but again, never endorsing any kind of drastic measure to be done. I will always tell them that nobody fits the gender stereotypes and that’s ok, because we need to end those stereotypes and not be enslaved by them. 

Once they are 18, have properly gone trough therapy and are still sure, I wouldn’t be able to stop them transitioning. I would love them and be there for them anyway. And if they want to detransition at any point I would be there for them as well.

e79ldyn,GenderCynicalCritical,"I think there are two very different ways of interpreting the ''love your body'' message - one is an unhealthy interpretation, meaning to make efforts to admire the beauty of one's own body, which can not only lead to the repression of one's true feelings, but also reinforces the importance of physical beauty as a measure of self worth.

The other, healthy, interpretation means to *treat one's own body with loving care* - which means not abusing it in any way, and eating a healthy diet and taking a healthy amount of exercise and rest and sleep, keeping it clean and dressing in comfortable clothes and shoes etc etc - and not allowing others to use it or abuse it. Self respect.","I think there is a third interpretation that kinda falls between the two. Accept your body. Appreciate it for what it is. Stop feeling like you need to change it, even though it may not live up to your or others ideals.

Realize that your body is neutral, it is social expectations and norms that make you feel the way you do about your body. If there is something you don't like about it, think critically about what it is you don't like and why you don't like it. Maybe changing will make you happier (if for example, you are unhappy about your fitness or health) but also be open to accepting its flaws and recognizing why it is you feel you need to change.

I believe dysphoria occurs when the unrealistic ideal people have for themselves conflicts with their physical reality. Their body is a constant reminder that they aren't what they want to be. The solution is not to mangle your body in a futile attempt to achieve the ideal, but to examine the ideal itself. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with any body; the values we place on our body are a product of the narratives we create about ourselves as part of a society. ",0

ezxtxu8,Ask_Radical_Feminists,"&gt;Maybe its pressure and anxiety when talking to someone of the opposite  sex in a romantic aspect that is getting in the way of you being able to  ""get the words out of your mouth"" as you put it.

It's just that I have no idea *how* or *when* to approach a woman I find attractive. I usually just look at them for a couple of seconds and then go about my usual business. AFAIK, there are a lot of contexts where it is not appropriate to go near a woman and talk to her, and have never read anything about the *right* contexts to do so (it also doesn't help that I'm not really that keen on going clubbing, at least not frequently).

I have one (and best) friend at this time in my life. A woman, ironically. I try to avoid talking about touchy subjects with her since I can't afford to lose her friendship. When it comes to social media, however, I can be as douchy as anyone else on those platforms, add to that my unpopular opinions on pretty much everything and you have the perfect recipe for someone who's unapproachable.

&gt;We all have our kinks, things that make us intolerable for our partners.  We all have some qualities that will make our gf/bf want t punch us in  the face. But eventually we all find someone who is willing to look past  those. And we will do the same for them.

I know, but it's hard for me to look past other people's flaws because, if they don't look past my flaws and keep mocking me for them, why should I look past theirs?","You might really benefit from a support group for people with ASD. There are many ways to approach women in public that are non-threatening and appropriate outside of a club, but you do run the risk of coming on too strong. A support group with people who face similar challenges might be the best place to build those skills. 

It is extremely challenging to “cold approach” women in most environments and have it go anywhere, but you can boost your odds by practicing making small talk with *everyone*. You’ll be much less nervous about approaching attractive women if you’re used to approaching everyone (men and women, old and young) on a daily basis. Start making small talk with men to get that feel for how to open a conversation and keep it going. It’s going to feel really awkward at first and you might have some bad experiences, but if you practice it regularly and treat it all as learning opportunities you can improve a lot. 

Establishing more friendships will also give you more opportunities to work on discussing your interests with integrity but in a way that’s not abrasive. 

Get off of social media. Don’t be a douche. You’re forming bad habits. Being antagonistic can be so pleasurable but it’s a horrible way to get your jollies. Focus on face-to-face interactions or on supportive online environments where you don’t get worked up. 

People who mock you for your flaws are people you should avoid.",0

czkicb5,seduction,"[FR]0 to 100... back to 0. Biggest learning experience I've had so far. About a week ago, I was at a friend's party. I was kind of feeling shy that day, and wasn't really in the mood to hit on girls. Later on, I saw this really cute girl there, and I pushed myself to talk to her. I was really physical with her from the very start, holding onto her hand after shaking her hand, putting my arm around her, etc. I led her over to sit on a couch after a couple of minutes of conversation. Almost immediately, I went in for the kiss. She turned away, but gave me her number before leaving. 

The next day, I decided to text her even though I didn't expect a response. We ended up texting a little, and set up a lunch date a couple days later. 

We had a great time during lunch, talking for hours after we had finished our food. While we were walking back to campus, she told me that she was sorry for leaving me at the party the other day, and really had to attend to her friend that night. I decided to go in for the kiss, and we ended up making out on the sidewalk for a while. Before parting ways, I made plans with her for the weekend. 

We met up and went to dinner for our next date, really hitting it off and having a great time. I then asked her to come back to my place and drink wine with me. In my room, we had a couple of drinks before getting on my bed to fool around. She wasn't down to have sex that night, so we ended up fooling around and drinking wine for hours. Later on, I took her into the city, where we explored late into the night. 

The next day, we met up at a club and spent a while there with some mutual friends. She stuck with me the entire time. Later in the night, all of us went to a friend's place to pregame, before going to a house party. At first, the party was fun -- we were dancing with each other the whole time and having a great time. Towards the end of the night though, we were both cuddling on the couch drunk. Some random guy comes over, finishes his drink, and throws his empty cup onto her (I made a post about this a couple days ago). I saw what happened, but was a pussy and didn't call the guy out for that. I basically ignored what had happened. 

She seemed a little upset over what had happened, and was a little distant for the rest of the night. She was all over me up until the incident. The next day, she texted me saying that we aren't clicking very well, and that we'd be better off as friends. I tell her that's okay and that I still had fun with her. 

-----

I'll admit, I'm still a little bummed about the whole situation, but I ended up learning a LOT from the week and half that I've known this girl. This was the first time I've ever been super upfront with a girl, and unafraid of expressing my sexuality. I was always pretty handsy with her, stroking her hair, holding her close, also calling her sexy and saying how hot she is. I felt super confident around her, and wasn't afraid of making any moves. This was something I had a lot of trouble with in the past; I would always feel creepy complimenting girls or touching them, and in this case, I was fully confident about it. 

More importantly, I really learned the importance of being able to stand up for not only myself but also the girl I'm with. That night when the guy threw the cup at her, the douche openly disrespected my girl, and I didn't stand up for her. I basically let him walk over us, which is a pretty big deal. I don't blame her for being massively turned off by that. 

This also helped me realize that in general, I'm kind of submissive with other guys. I'm always the type to be really friendly with guys I don't know, hoping I don't get on their bad side. I'm generally afraid of confrontation, and would rather avoid it than stand up for myself. Two key examples from the past stand out to me: 1) In high school, this one guy bullied me for two years and I didn't stand up to him once. I finally got him to stop annoying me by ignoring him, but not once did I tell him what he was doing was not okay, or try to defy him in any way. 2) I was in a dance circle with a guy at a club once, and was destroying him. Everyone kind of knew I was winning, so he came over and slapped me in the ass and walked away. Everyone went ""Oooooh"" but I just stood there not doing anything. 

Even though I really liked this girl and it didn't work out with her, I'm glad I was able to get something out of this experience. This might sound a little philosophical, but maybe it wasn't meant to work out with her -- maybe this girl came into my life to teach me a specific lesson for the future. I now know that I need to learn how to stand up for myself, and not let other guys walk over me. I'm not exactly small (5'11 and 170 lbs), so I have no excuse for not standing my ground. My username is called ""nomorepussingout"", which applies to both guys and girls. 

UPDATE: Called her today, and apologized to her for that incident and in general kind of being a dick to her (I don't think I treated her very well overall... said some pretty vulgar things to her). She said that I was fine, that she basically forgot about that incident with the guy. She said she wasn't looking for a relationship, and didn't want to continue things because it would hurt more down the line. 

Overall, a little confused, because we did click very well, and she said she found me very attractive. But oh well, it was still a good learning experience. ","Don't go thinking you had to get up and get into a physical fight with the dude because of that. It was rude, yeah, but it was also petty and childish.

Pizzagate and the Podestas showed me the evil that runs this world. I was a hard atheist before October 2017. I was the last person who was going to pray to God. I got scared fucking straight learning about child rape, torture and sacrifice. Growing up in church no one ever said the Israelites were being cursed by God for sacrificing their children on giant fire statues. No one ever told me. What I learned while researching James Alefantis and the Podesta brothers woke me up to reality. People can claim pizza gate is fake but that doesn't take away the fact that pedophiles have hunting parties where they murder children, the occultists are still sacrificing children, etc. I had no. fucking. idea. how sick the world was.

God is preparing us and I can't go another day in my life believing otherwise. I know better now. I cannot sleep well until this child rape and sacrifice shit ends. The movement to sexualize children needs to end. The child pornography needs to end. The demand for such things needs to end. I won't sleep well until God rids the world of this evil.

dd48odm,metacanada,Bend over and bite down on the pillow the liberals are about to fuck us hard. ,"&gt; Bend over and bite down on the pillow the liberals are about to fuck us hard.

I'm a liberal. But if anything comes out of this, it's that **there are extremists on both sides and it's up to us Canadians to fight it**.  If what is ""alleged"" about Alexandre Bissonnette is true, it's possible he may have committed these murders out of his hatred of Muslims (but let's let the authorities investigate this).

As of today, if my understanding is correct, this is the greatest act of terror on Canadian soil with the most deaths and most injured.  However, I will not gloat and say ""see, it's not a Muslim, I told you so,"" because it's very well possible that an even greater act of terror can be committed by a radical Islamist on another day in the future.  Then the tables will turn and you'll be telling liberals like me ""I told you so.""

What I ask of the people in this forum is that you do your part to fight extremists on the far right - to prevent them from committing a similar act on Canadian soil.  **We need to fight extremists on both sides - on all sides.**  I know I share different beliefs than many of you, especially when it comes to immigration, but I think all of you reading this aren't out to commit murder on other Canadians, even if you have different beliefs than those Canadians.

If you can do your part to prevent another atrocity like this by the next ""Alexandre Bissonnette,"" whoever he or she may be,  you'll have made Canada a better place to live.  And as a liberal who does believe in helping refugees in dire need (even though you may disagree with me on this point), I will keep up the pressure on our government to properly vet refugees from Muslim countries, to use the highest standards of vetting, and to properly settle these refugees in supporting and loving communities so that we can lower the risk as much as possible of any of these refugees or their children becoming radical Islamic extremists in the future.

Edit: My message isn't about gun control.

Boys needed to learn more about STEM so that the country can compete internationally. There are a lot of upsides to this, but one that will be relevant to this subreddit: it will be harder for expats to just laze around in Indonesia when the cost of living is higher.

2) War

Power dictates all. Those who wins the war controls the narrative. Boys need to strive to strengthening this country. Hopefully, boys will learn that a good country needs to have a strong military (tech-wise, men-wise, etc.) and aspire to that.

3) Women

Boys in Indonesia needed to be taught about the sexual dynamics and female nature: hypergamous, disloyal, and childish (I'm a big believer in taking women's rights away, think of me what you will.) Right now, the feminist movement is rising, and boys needed to know that equality is a lie, and when the country is invaded again, these women will just suck the invader's cock while they will be killed or turned into a slave.

Why were his comments not removed?

He blatantly violated both of these rules:

&gt;&gt;Posts that contribute nothing but attack others, are blatantly offensive, or antagonistic will be removed. The use of hate speech or repeated abusive language will result in a ban from the community.

&gt;&gt;Posts which do nothing but dismiss others and repeatedly accuse them of unfounded accusations could be subject to removal and/or banning. This includes the use of the word ""shill"" or similar comments used in a context with the effect of discrediting another poster.

**Why were his comments not removed given they are clearly in violation of the rules in /r/Canada ?**

&gt;You were given an easy way out with a simple post removal.  

What?  How?  By having my defence of myself removed?  

How does that make any sense.  Any outsider reading it would believe I had cowered, and would interpret that as me having no defence for myself, which was simply not the case.

In addition, you still have not explained how the original comment, which was an honest and fair defence, you have not explained how this was a violation.  

&gt;When you decide you are above the rules I have no choice other than to ban you.  As you have already been banned before and this time you were on your best behaviour I have to assume your best behaviour includes a complete and total disregard for our rules.

&gt;You were banned for posting a comment that had already been deleted and proving you will not follow the rules of r/Canada.  

Twice now you've claimed I have broken the rules.

Actually Ditto...  What you just stated above.  That's not a Rule.

csw05y6,TheRedPill,"Guy rejects woman because of her weight in the nicest way possible, gets socially eviscerated by hamsters and white knights. https://archive.is/tZXCu

**TL;DR:**
Guy goes on a Tinder date with an overweight woman. He writes her a rejection saying that while he admired her mind and personality, he couldn't get past what her body looked like. White knights and feminists proceed to socially impale the guy for ""body shaming.""

&gt; ""This woman had the best response when a Tinder date said she was too fat to fall in love with""

Yep, that third picture of her is her stuffing some kind of processed, sugary bullshit into her mouth (A Viennese whirl, she calls it). No body photos? Check. As we all know, that definitely means she's a fatty. Women with nice bodies love showing them off so that they can get ogled (and hopefully fucked) by alphas.

While this guy fucked up in the first place by even going on a date with a girl who had no body picture, he was at least was nice enough to write her a rejection telling her why he wasn't interested. I would've just politely excused myself immediately with no subsequent contact. Dude sounds beta as fuck writing her a short essay on why he didn't want to see her again, but here's the best part:
&gt; ""We could be amazing friends, we could flirt and joke and adore each other and... f--k me... I would marry you like a shot if you were a slip of a girl because what you have in that mind of yours is utterly unique, and I really really love it... I'm a man... With all the red hot lusts of a man and all the failings of a man and I'm sure of my own body and its needs.""

I love this, because it really throws a core RP tenet out into the public sphere, that attraction can't be negotiated. The comments attack the double-standard where women won't date short men, and the hamstering in the comments from the women makes for a fantastic read.

If this were from a woman to a man, you would hope it would light a fire under his ass to get in the gym and get in shape. Since it was to a woman, the response is of course to shame the man instead of suggest that she might have something to work on. You're beautiful just the way you are. You go, girl! 

Hamster Wheel: **LIGHT SPEED**

**Lessons learned:**

* In online dating, if she has no body photos, she's fat.
* Body shaming is like talking about the Red Pill in public- don't do it in mediums that can affect your job or reputation. You will be socially eviscerated for suggesting that women need to practice self-improvement.
* You can't negotiate raw attraction. This guy loved her personality but understood that you can't fuck a personality and you can't fuck her PHD.",Lesson learned: Just shut up and walk away. No need to explain yourself. No one understands or wants to understand anyway.,0

I'm 17, about to graduate high school but theres this guy that I suddenly grew interest in and I wouldn't mind dating him for the last few months of school. I always found him cute but ever since this one time I chilled in a class he was in and we talked, he started to say hi to me and gave me hugs every time I saw him around school. 
The first few times I spoke to him it was so easy because I didn't think of him that way. But now i actually start to feel nervous and I can't think of a way to have a conversation with him, not that it gets weird.. since he talks about anything, but im afraid I'll be too quiet.
A few days back when he came to hug me I told him I thought he was cute and he said thanks and told me I was too. Then he sat with me and we started talking for a while until he had to leave. After that happened, the next day I was wondering what I should do next to keep it going.
I don't want to be going after him trying to flirt because I don't want to seem desperate or SOO interested. I have a friend who thinks he's really cute too and I'm kind of scared that he might find her more interesting than me. A guy she likes, likes me but i don't want him. So at times she jokes around and rubs in on some stuff the guy I like tells her or that he likes several of her stuff on facebook. Yesterday when I stepped into the cafeteria and headed to my friends table i saw him sitting next to her and they were talking. So I turned the other way and sat somewhere else. Later on that day my school had a presentation in the gym so everyone was in there and I sat beside him, since he was around several people I know. He told me he looked for me in the cafeteria and that he started talking to my friend, he said he thought it was cute how she doesn't like to say badwords. So I got kind of jealous. He began to point out a few girls that wanted to date him but that he didn't because they were either slutty or boring. And that he doesn't care if a girl is pretty. So it seems to be that he'd like decent girls (like my friend). and I'm pretty sure she's given off that impression pretty well.. 
I'm just not sure how to move forward with this...if i give him the ""i dont really care"" attitude to make him want me more it may not even work... and I'm afraid he'll just get along way better with my friend than me.. what do you people think or what are your tips to keep the thing going?","His job is to ask you out.

2. chat him up, when he is alone, with the following words ""I like you, Name,  and would be really happy, if we spend more time together""

ef90ayx,marriedredpill,"Own Your Shit Weekly - January 29, 2019 A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. 

We have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in “No More Mr. Nice Guy”. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. 

Think of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, don’t call the gym saying “Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?”. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger.

Finally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha.

**Weekly Failures:**   
Big one this week. What I would call a ""serious event"" ongoing.   

Work from home, nights. Was taking a break, watching some Dr. Anabolic videos about steroid usage (Reinforcing my decision to never turn to anabolics), watching some All-22 tape on the Rams, and was looking at fun new positions to try with the wifey on my phone.  

Wife wakes up, sneaks downstairs (I can absolutely hear her when she's walking normally, so clearly was trying to 'catch' me), sticks her head into my office and sees what I'm doing. Assumes I'm watching porn.   

Demands to see phone, see video I'm watching, who is she, how much are you paying for it, etc etc etc. Hamster wheel at light speed. I set a boundary 6-8 months ago about my phone. Hard. No. Every time she has the opportunity to get on my phone she goes full Sherlock and we end up with monster nonsense about some bullshit memes I send friends or some nonsense that gets discussed in a group chat.   

I'll leave out the bullshit here but basically she's upstairs crying in our bedroom and watching porn on her phone as ""revenge"". Did some beta bullshit where I snatched her phone from her hands when she started doing it, but realized how retarded I was being and basically backed off. She's either pregnant or about to have her period, emotions and hormones are in full flight. We've been fucking like rabbits the last month, with lots of aforementioned new positions being enjoyable for both of us and increased dominance in the bedroom being responded to extremely positively. Now I'm getting the riot act about her joining Tinder, cheating on me, wants a divorce, never going to have sex with me again... the usual ""end of the world"" nonsense she gets up to when her emotions are in total control.   

Disappointed in myself. Basic bitch nonsense looking at that shit on my phone, and my ""fight or flight"" reaction was still pretty shit-tier. I've been successful with monk mode and nofap thus far, no PMO beyond what I would call ""inspiration"" for positions to try. Fought the urge to DEER with her and shut down pretty hard with broken record. She continually escalated, as expected, to try to get me to cave.  

When she gets going, man. It's like a train with no brakes. I just STFU'd and calmly stared her down. Nothing else to really say. I doubt she's done at this point. Likely will end up with her leaving within the next 90 minutes.   

Continuing to escalate now to ""If I have another miscarriage because of the stress then it's 100% on you"" (I was told I was responsible for 'killing our child' after her first miscarriage at 4 weeks)  

Difficult. I want to cave, to take her hand and to tell her I'm sorry, that she's right and I'm a shitty man, show her what I was looking at, basically give in to her every demand. Why the everloving fuck do I want that?

I've said it before and I'll say it again. I was raised to be a fucking autist with women. Stupid decisions beget stupid arguments beget my Wife not knowing what the fuck is going on and losing her mind.   

**Body:**  
PR'd squat and bench last week. Coaching is helping a ton. 365 flew up easily, and benched 180x5 on a camber bar. Doing a powerlifting meet at the end of March. Hoping for a 400ish squat, 225ish bench, and 450ish DL. We'll see.   

Not much to say here. Been smashing 5/3/1 BBB accessories hard and eating like a whale. Definitely adding body fat, but adding visible muscle mass as well. Up to 178-180lbs. Will compete at 181 so I need to back off the eating to make my competition cut realistic.  

Wife had made comments about how I was visibily getting more body fat. Clearly prefers me lean, which is understandable, but bulk life is what it is.

**Career:**  
Volunteered to take on a big project that no one else wants to do. Pain point for the company and I've thrown my mind at it wholeheartedly. A lot of opportunity to add value and demonstrate additional value in the run-up to my salary negotiation in March. I *must* keep grinding here if I want to achieve my goals.   


**Mind:**  
Almost complete with MMSLP. Humorous, somewhat, in that implementing much of the reading has been so successful and now I got myself into this stupid situation.

Lost my Kindle Paperwhite, somehow. Think I left it at the gym, maybe? Angry. Reading on my Kindle Fire instead, but is much shittier in terms of battery life and overall experience. I'll consider it punishment for not keeping track of my possessions.   

Still sober. Still intend on being sober. The little addiction goblin on my shoulder has mostly shut up. I can honestly say I haven't had a problem dismissing the thoughts of seeking out weed again, which is nice. Early days, yet. I've gone 30 days before. Typically start to fall apart after 6 months to a year when complacency sets in. Some idle thoughts floating around about ""Well maybe just a little bit on vacation, or when she and the kid are gone for a weekend..."" Typical addict thoughts that are a shortcut to ruining any discipline or momentum I've built thus far.  

Daily reflections of conscience have really continued to help. Dedicating 5-10 minutes to a mental review of my day every time I sleep.   


**Goals:**  

Stand strong. Be the Oak. Navigate the storm.

I can't believe actual models complain about this, like they're mad people are treating them as an object, aka model? How bad can it be?

I might sound cold and maybe I do, but imagine an ugly girl and a pretty girl, with similar financial backgrounds. 

The ugly one can't work as a model so she works a regular job at a fast food place, while the pretty one is spotted by a crappy agency and gets scouted. Who has it better?

I agree that there's a lot of old, unnecessarily gendered wording floating around on pages like that (RAINN), but to act like an organization is ""erasing"" survivors, when it can claim those survivors as clients (in order to keep existing funding or to qualify for new funding based on demographics served), is kind of illogical.

Simu's build and height are ideal but his face is dead on common average if not below average for an Asian man.

c4kir29,nazi,"Exactly. I don't like what they did with the Holocaust and whatnot. The problem is that people are stupid, biased, and ignorant (referring to the people of today). If you just look past the Holocaust (which most people don't do), you'll realize that they were an amazing group of individuals. Most people don't realize what they contributed to science. The things they made were amazing! And it wasn't just war technology either. They worked on alternate energy, medicine, and despite what most people think, they were interested in space (although most of their space-related plans were intended to be post-war).

Another problem is that Nazi Germany culture and way of thinking was fairly esoteric.  For example, they approached gravity not with Einsteinian physics (as it was ""jew science""), but with quantum mechanics. That's quite possibly the reason why some of the best scientists in the world are still baffled by some of the things the Nazis achieved with their famous German ingenuity (not to mention the fact that they had some of the best scientists in the world, such as Robert Oppenheimer, Hans Kammler, and others).

unfortunately no, but they may be able to be destroyed.  very popular subreddits have fallen in the past due to insane moderation.

so let's help the mods ban ""problematic"" people.  let's give them a hand.  let's become their helpers.

make a new account that is not banned from me_irl, hasn't subbed or posted to /r/meirl or this subreddit, basically looking like a regular account in every way and can't be traced to your banned account.  if you can somehow change your IP address, even better, since I'm not sure whether subreddit mods can see IP's or not.  maybe go get an old alt that you have stashed away or make an alt just for this.

then use the website www.metareddit.com to search peoples comments in /r/me_irl.  search for ""bitch"", ""gay"", ""she's hot"", ""boobs"", ""tits"", ""retard"", anything and everything that those nutjobs have banned people for. (search using ""google"" to make it easier to see a bunch of results at once, and easier keep track of comments you've already done http://i.imgur.com/on9xG9E.png)  then report the comments.  the mods will ban the users, creating tons of negative publicity that will quickly spread through reddit, and further populating /r/meirl",0

Germany's 30 largest listed companies have a total turnover of more than EUR 1,100 billion and have over 3.5 million employees - but employ no more than 54 refugees with permanent employment a year after that more than a million migrants and refugees came to Germany, writes SvD Economics.

The figures, reported by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, after calls to the companies, puts the finger on the many unsolved problems of integration. Lack of German language skills, not qualified, and lengthy asylum processes that destroy the motivation, writes the newspaper.

- Most of the refugees are well trained and motivated. Mercedes needs them, cheered Daimler chairman, Dieter Zetsche, in September last year. 

- At best, the wave of refugees will lay the foundations for a ""new economic miracle"" in Germany, he said. 

In the media, the image of a stream of engineers, doctors and programmers who are just waiting to show what they can do, was made.

But the problem is that most of the refugees and migrants do not have the work experience or training that German companies require.

The German industry needs a highly qualified workforce, and of the 663,000 available jobs by the end of June, there were only 113,000 that did not require high skills and a solid experience, and so far only 54 migrants have got one of those 113,000 jobs. 

To bring in more migrant labor, Angela Merkel's party the Christian Democrats has therefore proposed that companies are allowed to go below the minimum wage of 8.50 euros during the first six months. But the proposal is highly controversial in the government where the Social Democrats warn that migrants will take unskilled jobs from Germans.","&gt; turnover of more than EUR 1,100 billion and have over 3.5 million employees

e7tr4ao,race,"Empathic function varies among ethnic groups According to research, the empathic function is better developed in Northwest Europeans than in other ethnic groups. In Sweden, Kindergarten personnel report that immigrant children often lag behind several years in their empathic development. Peter Frost says: 

&gt;In some cultures, natural selection may have increased this capacity in both sexes and extended it to a wider range of social interactions. This scenario would especially apply to Northwest Europeans, who have long had relatively weak kinship. They have consequently relied more on internal means of behavior control, like affective empathy ([We are not equally empathic | Frost](http://evoandproud.blogspot.se/2014/11/we-are-not-equally-empathic.html))

Is this an evolutionary mistake that will lead to our demise?

&gt;East Asian societies have pursued a similar path of cultural evolution while having relatively low levels of affective empathy and empathic guilt. They seem to have done so by relying more on external means of behavior control (shaming, family discipline, community surveillance) and by building on cognitive empathy through learned notions of moral duty. Meanwhile, Northwest European societies have had their capacity for empathy pushed to the limit, as seen in the commonly heard term ""aid fatigue."" And there is no easy way to turn it off. The only real way is to convince oneself that the object of empathy is morally worthless. Was it all an evolutionary mistake? Time will tell. ([Affective empathy, an evolutionary mistake? | Frost](http://evoandproud.blogspot.ca/2014/09/affective-empathy-evolutionary-mistake.html))

The report further states that currently, it is not possible for presumed transsexual individuals to choose not to undergo surgery - if they are approved for sex reassignment, they are expected to undergo treatment immediately. Those who wish to remain ""non-operative"" (as well as those who cross-dress and/or identify as genderqueer) are considered their biological gender, and as such they are likely to face harassment as being homosexuals and subject to the same laws barring homosexual acts.[4]

","No one in the West is seriously claiming the way Iran does things is a good idea. I'll freely agree that no, we shouldn't force gay men to transition, but that's sort of beside the point.

The second does not say what you think it does, and since it's the only citation for the third I'll address them together. They say that post-transition trans people do worse *than the general population*, not than their pre-transition peers. Transition is enormously stressful and carries massive social cost, and in particular, the study you're talking about focused on people transitioning way back in the 80s. They note specifically:

&gt;&gt; In line with the increased mortality from suicide, sex-reassigned individuals were also at a higher risk for suicide attempts, though this was not statistically significant for the time period 1989–2003.

&gt;&gt; Transsexual individuals were at increased risk of being convicted for any crime or violent crime after sex reassignment (Table 2); this was, however, only significant in the group who underwent sex reassignment before 1989.

&gt;&gt; ... the overall mortality rate was only significantly increased for the group operated before 1989. However, the latter might also be explained by improved health care for transsexual persons during 1990s, along with altered societal attitudes towards persons with different gender expressions.

TL;DR: early transition treatments and shitty people explain the difference, not that transition is a bad thing in and of itself.

The last one's barely even worth addressing - it's a panicked bunch of religious conservatives similarly mis-citing the report from the previous two links and with literally one listed ""victory"" of a trans person who ""let the Lord into their heart"".",2

------------------------------------------
Disrespect for Asians. I consider the passiveness in this case to be a failure of Asians in standing up to blacks.

In this case it needs to be done subtly. Wait for the right moment when the crowd is tired of him talking. Then move in and take away the mic and start talking again to re-establish Asian leadership of the protest.

It is unacceptable to have black people taking over an Asian protest for Asian victims of racism. It makes us look so weak that we're unable to stand up for ourselves and need black people to do it for us.

In this case having black allies is an alliance, one formed by mutual interests that falls apart when the mutual interest is gone. It is the sort of case where it pays to always be ready for your allies to become your rivals. Remember that there are no permanent friends or allies, just permanent interests.

During the alliance there is cooperation but also competition. Competition over who leads, who contributes more, and who makes the most visible contributions that establishes who is higher and who is lower in the cooperative effort. When black people take over the protest they place themselves above Asians in the alliance and cooperative effort towards the mutually beneficial goal.

Another effect is that the ones who are highest in the cooperative effort end up reaping the most benefits from it. The ones who are lower end up being ignored with no one caring that they didn't reap any benefits. Do you like being lower in cooperative efforts? I've been there and I don't.

d28t93l,marriedredpill,"I married an ex porn star Alright, I know, catchy title. It's true though. 

A while back my wife(38, I'm 25. She was my first. Can you say oneitis?) told me she use to be on one of those camgirl sites. That she made good enough money for it to be her only source of income for a while. Well, cool stuff, whatever.

More recently, I learned she had her own website. Didn't think about it much but kind of been wanting to ask if she still had pics/videos/whatever. She was 32 when we got together. People have always told us they think we are the same age and can't believe it when she tells them her birth date. That’s made it very easy to commit to an older woman, but recently our age difference has been bringing me pain, as she got ill for two years. 

She’s back to being healthy, still looks God damn amazing, just not fit, perky 25 year old amazing. So of course I want to see those pictures.

Question #1: Will I ever be in a place to ask for her old pics? Don't know how unhealthy of a thing that is to focus on and try to get but whatever. If.you're a man you'll understand wanting to see em.

So recently I managed to find an archived version of her own website. It was membership based so only bio page, preview pics and q&amp;a, but whatever. It fucking drives me crazy to look at/think about it. How she looked/sounded like every man's fucking dream girl. Perfect body, perfect fucking face, extremely sexual but too shy to fuck around like mad hell(hence the website &amp; cam stuff), dressed up in all kinds of things, loved giving head and getting it rough, into all kinds of kinks, the list just fucking goes on.

(Just for clarification, her website was all solo stuff, all privately run by herself, so I guess this isn't really pronstar status but anyways)

I know I can get some of that back, but now that she's nearing her 40s, it'll just never be the same. And that’s painful as fuck, not having been with her when she was in her prime. Some consolation is found in thinking I can work my way up to being allowed(I hate to say it that way, but this is how my beta self thinks about it at the moment) to date around and fuck whatever younger chick I can get. Still not the fucking same.

What I want is impossible to get and it fucking drives me insane how bad I want it. I guess this is just some over the top oneitis that's gotta get broken somehow, but yeah, in my mind, she was fucking perfect. 

Aging sucks for women. She's still as hot as they come, just not 25 year old hot. So yes, our sex life is fucking amazing, she's been telling me how she doesn't know how it got this fucking good so fast(remember she was ill. We also went through lots of shit and it had driven us apart), talks dirty back to me, sucks my cock before sex like she used to. I know it'll keep getting better(thanks mrp), but I can't shake off the fact I never fucked her like that(at all for that matter) when she was at her peak of attractiveness. I'm as jealous as it gets of her ltr at the time.

Anyways, here comes questions. Anyone else experience something similar with their aging wife?

Any hope for pictures, short of taking her old computer by myself to the shop to get the stuff off her old hard drives and hope it's in there?

Any hope for beating oneitis for my wife's past self? Sounds weird to write it out but that's how I feel. I've felt like that for a while but seeing her old website’s amped it up unbearably.

Is dating other women while staying commited a good option? Anyone else do it with their wife's consent? She's been telling me a lot how she doesn't want me to leave her - she seems insecure about the age difference, hence why I think fucking other women might be an option she might consider down the line. Lastly, does thinking about that make me a selfish pos? More importsntly, should I give a fuck?


**TL:DR**

Wife is 12 yrs older. Been with her 5 yrs. I pin hard for her 25yo self, especially after seeing an archived version of her personal porn site she use to run by herself.

I want those goddamned pictures. Will I ever be able to ask her?

Anyone experience regret as their wife's SMV goes down as she ages?

Any tips on beating oneitis? She was my first, and her old website makes her look even more fucking perfect to me.

Chinese language has thousands of characters and more specific words for abstract concepts. I think every language has flaws but it seems like overkill to make students have to spend more time memorizing different characters and adding a new word that could be easily understood with a modifier like in the English language. It is also unfair to compare primitive tribes that never had a written language to other races that have written languages for thousands of years.,0

fddvw97,truelesbians,"Hi from a detrans woman Hi, I’m a 20 year old woman who has lived the past 3 years as male. I’ve been on testosterone for that time, but have now decided to quit. I am not a man because I’m attracted to women. I am not a man because I like “men’s clothing.” I am not a man because I am a woman with short hair. I am not a man. And now, even though I look and sound like a man, I am still a woman. In fact, I am a lesbian woman. I just wish I could have had this realization before altering my body so drastically. Even if other people cannot recognize me as a woman, I value the 17 years I lived as one, and hope to find my place within womanhood for the rest of my life to come.

Edit: I just want to thank everyone for the incredible amount of support and positivity I’ve received here. It’s been very encouraging as I’m going through this difficult and lonely time.","Tbh, a woman with a strong body build and a bit of a husky voice is hot to me.

dr1vilk,asktrp,"I’m using my new situation in life (body, money, etc) for sex and entretainment with women, and I’m loving it. Why TRP says that is counterproductive? I’m 36, been a loser until 31, made a 180 with my life and now I earn well, have tons of confidence and own (technically) a company.

Inside, I’m the same guy I was since my twenties: I love being with women (I enjoy their bodies), I finally get to have sex with them, and I especially get to enjoy the freedom I have now.

I’m not settling down, but I can see myself doing this for the next 10 years. I like my job, I like my “hobbies”, and all of that allow me to get enough money to raise my SMV and... throw my face into that pair of tits that I could never get until a couple of years back.

I’m essentially admitting that whatever I do with my life will probably end up being used to sleep with women.

For example, I enjoy videogames as much as I did before. Yesterday (saturday) I woke up earlier, did some really cool work stuff all morning, played some videogames/read a bit in the afternoon, went to the gym (my garage!) on the late afternoon, ate dinner and went to watch a movie on my neighbor’s house. As always, we ended up banging. Tomorrow I’m flying to New York, where my two “plates” are already waiting for me. See? I get to do EVERYTHING I ever wanted...

They were talking about a female professor, praising her for being so good at what she does but also calling her a MILF multiple times. I felt extremely uncomfortable but I couldn't get myself to interfere.

It wasn't the first time I heard guys using that term referring to an adult woman. The first time I read it was on a viral video where a kid sitting next to his mom on a baseball game was having some sort of  staring contest with the camera, the YT comments were full of guys calling his mother a MILF. I felt disgusted after I looked it up. I've been seeing it more and more on Reddit since then.

It saddest me to think this woman worked so hard in her life just to be seeing like a porn category by her own students.

As a lesbian I know how it feels to be treated like garbage by idiots who believe my sexuality exists for their sexual pleasure. This whole incident reminded me of a time some idiot online told me lesbianism wasn't real, that it was nothing but a porn category and lesbians were just attention seekers.

I really don't expect a lot from people who jerk off to women being treated like garbage on a daily basis. I don't think most of these guys see us as human beings. That's why we're cautious on the street and then they call us paranoids. That's why we need our own damn spaces.

Sorry for the long rant. ","This is one of the reasons I don’t trust men who are attracted to me (or any man at all actually). 90% of the time it’s either an “ethnic” fetish or a disabled fetish. Oh, and when men call me “thick” it fucking pisses me off.",2

But i can see why a lot of people are uncomfortable delving into the realities of the dating market but it's highly relevant if you are planning on transitioning.

You sound smart. You do realize that it's the **BEHAVIOR** of you dumb niggers that we hate and not the skin color right? Name me one thing that blacks do for society that actually benefits everybody.

You probably weren't even good slaves, that's why we had to whip you so much. Guarantee the only reason you were whipped was because you were lazy as fuck and complained too much. I'd take a mexican over a lazy nigger any day of the week. All races hate niggers. Every single fucking one, and they have every reason too. For the most part, you blacks are cancer to society and useless, crime ridden, loud, obnoxious, violent, impulsive, cocky, arrogant, ignorant, violent, self entitled, lazy, stupid, free loading, violent, careless, ugly, smelly, never invented shit (including a written language or a wheel), savage niggers. And did I mention violent?

Name me ONE black civilization, city, town that is well governed and safe. Oh wait, there is no such thing. Because we don't live in fantasy land. Enslaving you non advanced monkeys was the worst mistake America has ever made. If it wasn't for whites, your race would be so insignificant. You would still be living in mud huts and you would all be killed by Asians and they would take over your land, Africa. Yet, white people are evil? Give me a fucking break, niggers are evil (just look at the statistics). Whites are the best thing to ever happen to the negro and all you guys do is bitch and moan about white privilege which is a fucking myth at this point. Whites are literally the world police. If you hate whites so much then move back to Africa. Do it, prove the world wrong. Prove that you guys can sustain a functioning society that benefits the world on your own. I give you less than a year before you start killing each other. Oh wait, shit is happening right now in EVERY black society.

Blacks are the only race where it is acceptable for them to riot and act like baboons. That is because the whole world knows that blacks are like retarded children.

dm6ml2b,aznidentity,"Let me  discuss  a few points. 

 1. First, this  sub is open  to both genders and has been for a long time now. Although their are probably  not as much  female participation  on r/aznidentity as  one would like  , it has been a large improvement versus  before.

 2. We remove  all misogynistic  comments  and comments that are hateful  to  AF, as some extreme  members  seem to repeatedly  make on this sub  which makes it unwelcome  to AF who participate here.

 3.  Although  r/asianmasculinity has a much larger sub count then  AI , I think one can easily notice  that the amount of activity  on this exceeds  it.

 4. This sub has a sometimes excessive  asian-male bent to it , and that  may or may not be  a concern.  It would  be good to have  other general asian diaspora  related content  to  keep it healthy. 

 5. In terms of expanding  the tent , I think we are already doing  our best in terms of audience.  Ome thing that the sub could  improve  on or perhaps make a compromise  is to  make the  subreddit more welcoming  to AF.   Thankfully, I think we've  done a decent job on this so far , but like  anything, it can be improved.  I did a subreddit census  some months  back , and on the question  of "" Should we open this subreddit to allies"" , many  wanted the subreddit to stay true to Asians only. Opening  this sub   to allies   seems to be a  bad idea in light  of that - however  r/asiansubdebates seems to be perfect for that.

d7xpnul,KotakuInAction,"[SocJus] Its 1984 In The UK - Man ordered to pay over $500 USD for referring to a Muslim man arrested for threatening teenage girls with a 12 inch knife on Reddit, a ""monkey"". Reddit admins turned over his info to British Police. ","So they start taxing people for speech. Some program becomes dependent on that revenue. The people catch on and alter their speech to avoid the fines. The program loses funding so then they need to broaden the definition of offensive speech to keep revenue up further narrowing speech in the UK.

Then Some politicians base growth of the program on projected increase in revenue via such fines. So again the police are pressured to more aggressively prosecute speech to meet the new quota.

It happens with tickets and fines in the US and was a major point of contention between the people of Ferguson and the police. Federal authorities investigated the Ferguson police and found they were being pushed to increase the number of tickets year after year to meet demand for increased revenue.


Once government gets its hands on increased taxes (Through fines or otherwise) they spend it on growing the government. That revenue than becomes expected and is almost impossible to shrink government. Once a bill passes unless there is an expiration date it's not going anywhere. The same will happen with all the cash coming in from policing speech. They won't let it go and will need to take extreme measures to see the funding keeps coming in. Like with red light cameras. Once the population adapts to their presence in order to keep up funding they change the timing on the yellow light to increase the number of tickets issued. This ultimately causes more accidents but it's okay how else will they fund exorbitant government contracts for their friends in the private sector who funded their campaign?",0

I actually responded with a user's name who *admitted* to being funded by Hillary, worked for a PR firm, and this user had commented on their subreddit in the last 2 days.  No ban for them.  They kept my 1 week ban despite the fact that I didn't even *call* anyone a shill, merely *asked*.  /r/politics is fucked.

Edit.  Here's my actual message response to the mods:
&gt;Mod: ""If you have evidence someone is paid to post, message the moderators so we can take action""

My response:

&gt;Since you specifically asked me, I have a genuine paid shill for you. /u/SnitchinTendies [actively admits](https://i.sli.mg/2QNGTc.png) to being a paid PR person for Clinton. The post I highlighted talks specifically about their methodology they use to push narratives and change the political discourse.

Promiscuity makes is harder to emotionally bond with someone and therefore makes it difficult to make a family. There have been studies that prove that the chance for divorce increases with more sexual partners a person had. Divorce is related to single motherhood which is connected to increased chance of criminal behavior, meaning a person raised by a single mother has a far greater chance of being a criminal than someone raised in the nuclear family.

There are numerous other problems associated with promiscuity too like STDs and abortions. Even if you're pro-choice you should still be against high rates of abortions. That was a major talking point back in the 90s. It was Clinton that said abortions should be ""safe, legal, and **rare**.""

Promiscuity is simply the cheap and shallow version of monogamy. They get the sex but none of the safety, security, and loyalty.

ehn64hq,GCdebatesQT,"If using the bathroom is just about that, then why do some trans people make a big deal out of getting validation instead of just using the bathroom? This question has two parts but mainly I'm wondering why is it that some transpeople or from what I've seen MtF's seem to care more about receiving validation from not being stared at, or being confronted when using the bathroom of their preference vs just being able to use the bathroom. I've seen so much coming from their side that all they want is to use the bathroom but at the same time it seems to be that they just want validation? I'm not comfortable with a transwoman in the women's bathroom whatsoever, and I know I'm not alone with that. I'm just wondering if all of these sentiments boil down to ""passing"" or is this more of them trying to force us out of our spaces. 

Also, I've never seen one so maybe it's not a thing yet but, would anyone be opposed to gender neutral change-rooms or locker rooms, in gyms/spas? From doing a little research in GC I've found that most women  are pro gender neutral bathrooms, as long as they don't take up women's bathrooms or replace women's bathrooms (I agree with and feel the exact same way) but I wonder if there is still opposition to this, and if there is any opposition to gender neutral change rooms? Is it practical? One spa I went to had a normal shower room but something that stood out to me was that it curtains to pull for privacy while in the shower. I thought that was a good addition because even with the dividers sometimes one might one want extra privacy. I think a gender neutral change-room with individual stalls with doors and showers with curtains could work? Or maybe it's a bit more complicated than that? Gender neutral bathrooms are more simple I think, in that the only time anyone would ""meet"" others is at the sink. ","It makes sense to me that people who see themselves as women would like to use women's facilities without being stared at or confronted.

More gender-neutral facilities would be a great thing, for trans women who don't feel that they pass well enough, for nonbinary people (me), and for many others.  So while most facilities could remain segregated as before if that's what most users and private property owners want, I think gender-neutral facilities (with individual privacy) definitely have a place, and I support the current movement to make them more available.",0

c2wkd6h,masculism,"Feminism has gatekeepers: the ones who are most vocal, active, and ""out there."" This is true of a lot of movements. As much as they say it's ""feminisms"" and not The One True Feminism, there are feminist articles of faith (the oppressor/oppressed male/female dynamic being a big one, but lots of minor ideas that have emanated out of movement and academic feminism, too) that one may not question if you want to be a feminist in good standing. 

Trigger warnings are important to a lot of feminists because there is a thread of feminist thought that men consciously use (and have long used) violence - especially sexual violence - to keep women down. This is called patriarchal dominance. Thus, rape trigger warnings on radfem blogs are simply keeping women from being re-victimized, as opposed to those men who talk about rape/stalking/fat-hate/what-have-you flippantly.

Unfortunately, as you allude to, this essentially amounts to, ""hey, everyone should be nicer to each other!!"" The author of the piece you link to astutely writes

&gt;trigger warnings are unrealistic. They are the dream-child of a fantasy in which the unknown can be labeled, anticipated, and controlled. What trigger warnings promise — protection — does not exist. The world is simply too chaotic, too out-of-control for every trigger to be anticipated, avoided, and defused.

The idea that we can avoid triggering PTSD-like symptoms in people is noble. The reality is that very few people give a flying fuck about your feelings, my feelings, or my Uncle Don's feelings, and that's part of the human condition. 

That's why I think trigger warnings are hippie bullshit.","I think they have a perfectly good place, but are obviously overused. The mere mention of men hating on fat chicks or the mention of rape is not the type of thing that would require a warning.

In the context of a trauma victim describing the trauma in graphic detail it makes plenty of sense, assuming you know how PTSD works.

You can call them hippie bullshit all you want but I'm guessing you've never sat through a PTSD flashback with a loved one...

&gt;U.S.S. Liberty

June 8, 1967, International Waters.

After surveying the U.S.S. Liberty for 9 hours, Israel attacked the ship with the intention to blame one of their enemies and involve the United States in it's conflict. 

During the attack the American flag was shot down, along with a second one servicemen tried to raise. 

34 men died, and 174 more were wounded. Napalm bomblets were dropped by French made Mystere jets, Mirage III fighters armed with rockets and torpedoes attacked the ship, and one vessel was jamming the Liberty's communications. 

However, a distress call managed to get through to the USS America, a carrier which sent two F-4's armed with nuclear weapons.  Defense Secretary Robert McNamara ordered the jets back to the USS America. Admiral David L. McDonald, the chief of Naval Operations said ""You get those fucking airplanes back on deck, and you get them back down."" 

Later, three attack boats came at the USS Liberty, one leaving a 40 ft. hole which flooded the lower compartments killing dozens of sailors. 

When the Liberty crew began to shuttle and flee on life boats/rafts, the Israelis attacked them as well. 


A mysterious USSR destroyer with the hull number 626/4 came to offer help, stayed at a parallel course until the USS Massey and USS Davis arrived, and then the ship returned to the Soviet 6th fleet. Soviets however said the ship wasn't there at the time and no records could be found in archives etc. 

"" . . .  an act of military recklessness reflecting wanton disregard for human life.""

Then Secretary of State Dean Rusk in a 10 June 1967 diplomatic note to the Israeli Ambassador.

""But I was never satisfied with the Israeli explanation. Their sustained attack to disable and sink Liberty precluded an assault by accident or soem trigger-happy local commander. Through diplomatic channels we refused to accept their explanations. I didn't believe them then, and I don't believe them to this day. The attack was outrageous.""
Rusk, As I Saw It, W.W.Norton, 1990. p 388

""I do not know to this day at what level the attack on the Liberty was authorized and I think it is unlikely that the full truth will ever come out. Having been for so long a staunch supporter of Israel, I was particularly troubled by this incident; I could not bring myself to believe that such an action could have been authorized by Levi Eshkol. Yet somewhere inside the Israeli government, somewhere along the chain of command, something had gone terribly wrong--and then had been covered up. I hever felt the Israelis made adequate restitution or explanation for their actions . . .""

Clark M. Clifford, then-Presidential Advisor and Chairman of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, Counsel to the President

""That the Liberty could have been mistaken for the Egyptian supply ship El Quseir is unbelievable. El Quseir has one-fourth the displacement of the Liberty, roughly half the beam, is 180 feet shorter, and is very differently configured. The Liberty's unusual antenna array and hull markings should have been visible to low-flying aircraft and torpedo boats. In the heat of battle the Liberty was able to identify one of the attacking torpedo boats as Israeli and to ascertain its hull number. In the same circumstances, trained Israeli naval personnel should have been able easily to see and identify the larger hull markings on the Liberty.""

Clifford, in a memorandum to the President, 18 July 1967


""I found it hard to believe that it was, in fact, an honest mistake on the part of the Israeli air force units. I still find it impossible to believe that it was. I suspect that in the heat of battle they figured that the presence of this American ship was inimical to their interests, and that somebody without authorization attacked it.""

Paul C. Warnke, then-General Legal Counsel of the Department of Defense


""American leaders did not have the courage to punish Israel for the blatant murder of its citizens. . . . The Liberty's presence and function were well known to Israel's leaders. ...Israel's leaders concluded that nothing they might do would offend the Americans to the point of reprisal. If American leaders did not have the courage to punish Israel for the blatant murder of American citizens, it seemed clear that their American friends would let them get away with almost anything.

George Ball, under secretary of state at the time writing in The Passionate Attachment: America's Involvement with Israel, pages 57-58.


""It's an American ship!"" the pilot of an Israeli Mirage fighter-bomber radioed Tel Aviv as he sighted the USS Liberty on June 8, 1967. Israeli headquarters ordered the pilot to attack the American ship.

former US Ambassador to Lebanon Dwight Porter describing transcripts of communications he saw, reported in syndicated column ""Remembering the Liberty"" by Rowland Evans and Robert Novak, November 6, 1991.



""I don't think that there's any doubt that it was deliberate.... [It is] one of the great cover-ups of our military history.""

David G. Nes, the deputy head of the American mission in Cairo at the time


""No one in the White House believed that the attack was an accident.""

George Christian, Press Secretary to President Lyndon Johnson in letter to James Ennes, 1978.


""The Israelis told us 24 hours before that ...if we didn't move it, they would sink it. Unfortunately, the ship was not moved, and by the time the message arrived the ship was taking on water.""

John Stenbit, Assistant Secretary of Defense for C3Im in an address to the AFEI/NDAI Conference for Net Centric Operations, Wednesday, April 16, 2003



"". . . the commander of the Sixth Fleet was informed by the Washington Intelligence Apparatus that it had evidence that the Liberty was going to be attacked and to provide protection for it. That message was never really acted upon, and the ship was dead in the water when it was hit. So the end result was no accident.""

-- Raymond Tate, Deputy Assistant SecNav and Deputy Director, NSA, Worldwide C3I and Telecommunications (1980, pp. 25-47) 




""I can only conclude that the coordinated attack by aircraft and motor torpedo boats on the U.S.S. Liberty 15 1/2 miles north of Sinai on June 8 which killed 34 officers and men of the Navy and wounded another 175 was deliberate.

""The fact that the U.S.S. Liberty was a Victory hull vessel, hundreds of which were produced and used by the U.S. Navy during World War II and since, rules out the possibility of mistaken identity. Every ship recognition book in the world has, for years, identified the characteristic Victory hull and supersturcture of the U.S.S. Liberty as U.S. Navy property . . .

""Whatever the reason for the attack, it was an act of high piracy. Those responsible should be court-martialed on charges of murder, amongst other counts. The Israel Government should pay full reparations to the United States and indemnities to the families of the Americans killed.""

Craig Hosmer, then-U.S. Representative, on the floor of the House of Representatives, 29 June 1967


""The Liberty ship incident - and indeed it was more than an incident - has been treated entirely too lightly by this Government. To say the lease, too little has been said about it. This useless, unnecessary and inexcusable attack took the lives of 34 American boys, wounded 175 others, and left many others in a state of horrified shock, to say nothing of what it did to a flag-flying vessel of the U.S. Navy. How could this be treated so lightly in this the greatest Capitol in all the world?

""I have heard Members of this House, and many, many others, say that if this had been done by others, the leaders of our Government would have moved in with sternness and appropriate action demands or even retaliatory action.

""These men at all times are entitled to the strong backing of every citizen of this land or every race and every creed. They are entitled to and should have the strong arm, as well as the strong voice of their Government and their people behind them. And who has spoken out in their behalf from this land since some of their number were so suddenly shot down and others so severely wounded on the Liberty ship?

""What complaint have we registered? What has Washington said? To tell you the truth, this great Capitol as well as this great Government - if it can still be called great - was and is as quiet as a tomb regarding this event?""

Thomas G. Abernathy, then-U.S. Representative, on the floor of the House of Representatives, 29 June 1967



""Those sailors who were wounded, who were eyewitnesses, have not been heard from by the American public. . . [Their story] leaves no doubt but what this was a premeditated, carefully reconnoitered attack by Israeli aircraft against our ship.""

-- US Senator Adlai Stevenson III in interview with Wm. J. Small, UPI, for publication September 28, 1980 



""The shame of the U.S.S. Liberty incident is that our sailors were treated as though they were enemies, rather than the patriots and heroes that they were.  There is no other incident--beyond Israeli attack on the U.S.S. Liberty--that shows the power of the Israeli Lobby by being able to silence successive American governments.  Allowing the lies told by the Israelis and their minions in the U.S. is disheartening to all of us who are proud of our servicemen.""

     --  James Abourezk, United States Senate, 1973-79 




""Certain facts are clear.  The attack was no accident.  The Liberty was assaulted in broad daylight by Israeli forces who knew the ship's identity.  ...The President of the United States led a cover-up so thorough that years after he left office, the episode was still largely unknown to the public -- and the men who suffered and died have gone largely unhonored.""

    --  Paul Findley, They Dare to Speak Out, Lawrence Hill &amp; Co., 1985, p166 



The ship was clearly identified, not only by its unique configuration but by a very large U.S. flag that was flown at the time. The weather was calm and the visibility was excellent. During this unprovoked attack 34 U.S. Navy men were killed and 171 wounded. Nevertheless, to this day the American public does not know why the attack took place and who was involved overall.

In my opinion, the United States government and the Israeli government must share responsibility for this cover-up. I cannot accept the claim by the Israelis that this was a case of mistaken identity. I have flown for years in both peace and war on surveillance flights over the ocean, and my opinion is supported by a full career of locating and identifying ships at sea. Based on the way this tragedy was handled both in the United States and in Israel, one must conclude that there is much information that has not been made available to the public.

The U.S. Fleet, positioned nearby, received a distress call from the USS Liberty, and one carrier dispatched a squadron to go to the defense of the disabled ship. Before the aircraft reached the Liberty, they received orders from Washington directing their return to their ship. Who issued those orders? So far, no one knows. In the United States all information available to the U.S. government indicating those who participated in controlling this operation from Washington, together with the exact text of orders transmitted to the Mediterranean Fleet, has never been made public.

Thomas H. Moorer, Admiral, US Navy (Ret.), Forword to Assault on the Liberty



On the strength of intercept transcripts of pilots' conversations during the attack, the question of the attack's deliberateness ""just wasn't a disputed issue"" within the agency.

Lieutenant General William E. Odom, former director, National Security Agency, interview with David Walsh on March 3, 2003, reported in Naval Institute Proceedings, June, 2003











&gt;Now, armed with this knowledge, are you surprised at these following videos?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dda-0Q_XUhk

","USS Liberty was an accident of friendly fire. Israel admitted to that and paid restitution... long long time ago - 47 years ago.

USS liberty was the civilian cargo vessel Simmons Victory converted to carry electromagnetic audio-surveillance devices to spy on Israel during a time of war.

Next time, don't try to get close to spy on a country which is in the midst of a major war with its enemies.

Even Egypt which was at war with Israel then thinks so. Read it [here](http://www.egyptindependent.com/node/515763).

Anyway, the truth is ""*Both the Israeli and U.S. governments conducted inquiries and issued reports that concluded the attack was a mistake due to Israeli confusion about the identity of the USS Liberty.*

*In May 1968, the Israeli government paid US$3,323,500 as full payment to the families of the 34 men killed in the attack. In March 1969, Israel paid a further $3,566,457 in compensation to the men who had been wounded. On 18 December 1980, it agreed to pay $6 million as settlement for the U.S. claim of $7,644,146 for material damage to the Liberty itself.*

*On December 17, 1987, the issue was officially closed by the two governments through an exchange of diplomatic notes.*"" 

**This was the first and ONLY(!) incident, 47 years ago, where Israel killed (friendly fire) American Soldiers.**

If anyone think that today, 2014, or since this incident in 1967, that Israel is trying to kill Americans or hurt them, then they are delusional.

Israel is the best friend of the USA, more than Europe, Russia, China, South America, etc.

Better to concentrate on the real enemies of the USA instead of unexplained and irrational hate for Israel.

deb1nnu,DarkHumor,"On the morning of September 11, 2001, 19 men armed with boxcutters directed by a man on dialysis in a cave fortress halfway around the world using a satellite phone and a laptop directed the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily-defended airspace in the world, overpowering the passengers and the military combat-trained pilots on 4 commercial aircraft before flying those planes wildly off course for over an hour without being molested by a single fighter interceptor.

These 19 hijackers, devout religious fundamentalists who liked to drink alcohol, snort cocaine, and live with pink-haired strippers, managed to knock down 3 buildings with 2 planes in New York, while in Washington a pilot who couldn’t handle a single engine Cessna was able to fly a 757 in an 8,000 foot descending 270 degree corskscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground, hitting the Pentagon in the budget analyst office where DoD staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had announced “missing” from the Pentagon’s coffers in a press conference the day before, on September 10, 2001.

Luckily, the news anchors knew who did it within minutes, the pundits knew within hours, the Administration knew within the day, and the evidence literally fell into the FBI’s lap. But for some reason a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists demanded an investigation into the greatest attack on American soil in history.

The investigation was delayed, underfunded, set up to fail, a conflict of interest and a cover up from start to finish. It was based on testimony extracted through torture, the records of which were destroyed. It failed to mention the existence of WTC7, Able Danger, Ptech, Sibel Edmonds, OBL and the CIA, and the drills of hijacked aircraft being flown into buildings that were being simulated at the precise same time that those events were actually happening. It was lied to by the Pentagon, the CIA, the Bush Administration and as for Bush and Cheney…well, no one knows what they told it because they testified in secret, off the record, not under oath and behind closed doors. It didn’t bother to look at who funded the attacks because that question is of “little practical significance“. Still, the 9/11 Commission did brilliantly, answering all of the questions the public had (except most of the victims’ family members’ questions) and pinned blame on all the people responsible (although no one so much as lost their job), determining the attacks were “a failure of imagination” because “I don’t think anyone could envision flying airplanes into buildings ” except the Pentagon and FEMA and NORAD and the NRO.

The DIA destroyed 2.5 TB of data on Able Danger, but that’s OK because it probably wasn’t important.

The SEC destroyed their records on the investigation into the insider trading before the attacks, but that’s OK because destroying the records of the largest investigation in SEC history is just part of routine record keeping.

NIST has classified the data that they used for their model of WTC7’s collapse, but that’s OK because knowing how they made their model of that collapse would “jeopardize public safety“.

The FBI has argued that all material related to their investigation of 9/11 should be kept secret from the public, but that’s OK because the FBI probably has nothing to hide.

This man never existed, nor is anything he had to say worthy of your attention, and if you say otherwise you are a paranoid conspiracy theorist and deserve to be shunned by all of humanity. Likewise him, him, him, and her. (and her and her and him).

Osama Bin Laden lived in a cave fortress in the hills of Afghanistan, but somehow got away. Then he was hiding out in Tora Bora but somehow got away. Then he lived in Abottabad for years, taunting the most comprehensive intelligence dragnet employing the most sophisticated technology in the history of the world for 10 years, releasing video after video with complete impunity (and getting younger and younger as he did so), before finally being found in a daring SEAL team raid which wasn’t recorded on video, in which he didn’t resist or use his wife as a human shield, and in which these crack special forces operatives panicked and killed this unarmed man, supposedly the best source of intelligence about those dastardly terrorists on the planet. Then they dumped his body in the ocean before telling anyone about it. Then a couple dozen of that team’s members died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.

This is the story of 9/11, brought to you by the media which told you the hard truths about JFK and incubator babies and mobile production facilities and the rescue of Jessica Lynch.

If you have any questions about this story…you are a batshit, paranoid, tinfoil, dog-abusing baby-hater and will be reviled by everyone. If you love your country and/or freedom, happiness, rainbows, rock and roll, puppy dogs, apple pie and your grandma, you will never ever express doubts about any part of this story to anyone. Ever.

ejtmppd,GCdebatesQT,"OMFG, I just finished watching the video, *finally...*

And man it was bad, and I mean ***BAD***. And keep in mind, I've actually enjoyed some of Contra's content in the past (I do think Contra is a very creative person, and I respect that, as a fellow creative person/artist), but this was a pathetic cringe-fest of epic proportions. I mean, sure, Contra was reasonable enough to admit there ARE differences between women and trans women (which I think is the bare minimum, but whatever), and that childhood socialisation is very important, but still.

That massive straw-man regarding the abolition of gender... made me want to scream. The misrepresentation of all GC feminists being trauma-laden radfems, or that you can only be gender critical if you view womanhood as a negative, painful identity. NO. Just NO. I don't identify as a woman. I AM A WOMAN. Because I'm a female *Homo sapiens*. And I like being a female. I like my body just the way it is, and make the best of my existing in an (improving) androcratic world. And yet, I'm firmly gender critical. Contra, you don't understand shit, clearly.

Also, why, for the love of goodness, does medical language (or language period) have to be inclusive?! The only imperative should be that it's ***accurate***! Scientific/medical research should not concern itself with freaking identity politics, jfc. Language by definition has to be exclusive, what's the point of separate words and linguistic categories otherwise??

I moreover don't understand Contra's point about the word slur??? I checked out the definition of the word, and it clearly has nothing to do with race or sexuality or identity politics specifically?? 

And please, your half-arsed attempt at appearing open-minded by inviting (***only***) ex-gcfems to engage in discussion doesn't fool any of us. How about the myriad of GC fems who aren't strictly radical feminists? Who don't frequent the GC sub? (Like me) How about the trans people who agree with a lot of us, or people who are somewhat in the middle?

Plus, just brushing aside GC feminists' concerns like that doesn't makes you enlightened, it just makes you an asshole, and that's disappointing.

Though I will say this: it was really shitty of Germaine Greer to call that transsexual person an ""it"". That's just not on.","&gt; Also, why, for the love of goodness, does medical language (or language period) have to be inclusive?! The only imperative should be that it's accurate!

If accuracy is your concern, shouldn’t you be celebrating the use of the inclusive and exclusive language of the brand Contra explores, as regards medical publication?  A variety of diseases and conditions can prevent cis women from menstruating.  In regards to menstrual health advocacy, the term “menstruators” is the **most concise and accurate term available**, so if exacting accuracy is more important than feelings then “pregnant person” is acceptable and “menstruators” is particularly efficient.

elpmwzz,GCdebatesQT,"QT: What is the strongest possible argument for the cotton ceiling? I'll be candid here: the cotton ceiling, as a concept, strikes me as incel-speak by another name. ""Society has brainwashed hot girls to want Chads, making them ignore Nice Guys"" is functionally indistinguishable from ""society has brainwashed lesbians to want vaginas, making them ignore Nice Trans Women."" Both are wrong.

With that said, the idea of the cotton ceiling and the necessity of breaking through it resonates with people. If you're one of them, please tell me why. What's the strongest case you can make for this viewpoint?

*Bonus Comments/Issues*

1. I don't see 'genital preference' as analogous to racial preferences. Racial preferences are either based on inaccurate stereotypes (i.e. Asian men have small dicks/Black women are too argumentative/etc.) or have more to do with social status than desire (i.e. people watching interracial porn but disdaining real-life people of colour). Obviously, both of these causes are awful.\* 'Genital preference', meanwhile, isn't stereotypical and *is* connected to a lack of desire. Am I mistaken?  
\*edited to add: As I discussed in the comments, I have no issue with aesthetic preferences which make a person likelier to date within one race than another.   

2. Even if the cotton ceiling vanished tomorrow, I'm not sure how that would help single trans people. The majority of them, after all, haven't had bottom surgery. They're asking lesbians to want penises and gay men to want vaginas. Aren't they worried that, having broadened our sexual horizons, we'll just date the straights instead? Especially because straight people have significant financial and social privileges?

(GC or undecided folks, you're more than welcome to participate, especially if you've encountered nuanced arguments for the cotton ceiling that don't get much airtime.)","If you structure the majority of your social spaces so they exclude trans women, that is going to affect dating, etc. regardless of personal attraction.

It also goes for drinking, disability, poverty, transportation, and so on. Our society is fubar that way.

I'm not saying that everyone who's attracted to some women can or should be attracted to trans women, but some people *are* attracted to trans women, and to non-trans women, and not to either type of men.

It should still go w/o saying that no one should be pressured into pretending she is or isn't attracted to either group, or pressured to have sex she doesn't want.",0

feksjv6,GCdebatesQT,"QT: why are there so many pregnant FTMs if they're dysphoric about their female functions? This is a weird question, but I am actually curious about this phenomenon. I stumbled upon the subreddit r/pregnant and on the front page I saw at least 3 FTM posting about their pregnancy. I digged a little and *many* users have a FTM flag next to their username. Considering that FTMs are quite rare to begin with and that most of those FTMs are (supposedly) heavily dysphoric about female functions, how would you explain the high concentration of pregnant FTMs on subs like r/pregnant? Giving birth is one of the most female experience there is and is deeply associated with womanhood and the female body.

 I don't understand how someone who feels like a man would want to go through that. I'm a female who has dealt with dysphoria in the past (thankfully I have managed to lessen it with lots of therapy) and pregnancy is terrifying to me. 

I'm not here to judge FTMs who are pregnant, I just want to know why you think the phenomenon is so prevalent and why they would be comfortable enough to live through an elective experience that forces them to be seen as a woman. 

I'd be interested in replies from QT (especially FTMs), transmedicalists and dysphoric women (i.e. females) as well.

Edit: it has come to my attention that the acronym might refer to ""first time mom"" on the r/pregnant sub. But my point still stands. I know some FTMs on FTM specific subs who have talked about being pregnant or wanting to be pregnant.","I haven't had much experience with FTM folk, so I can only make an educated guess. But I know I want to be a parent, and while I don't regret putting anything on ice or not being able to have biologically related kids I know it is important to others.

In the case of a gay couple (and lets please not get into semantics over FTMs being in a straight or gay relationship) they could want their own kids as well. So it could be that an FTM in some cases does it so they have genetically related kids. In cases with a trans man and woman, could maybe be the woman has issues with carrying child.

I can see a few reasons why a trans man might do it if possible, and it could simply be the desire to have kids that are related to them is stronger then the dysphoria they have over having a womb. Basically, even if they don't like it they might use it to have a family...which considering how in America it can be difficult for LGBT parents to adopt, I can easily see some feeling this is the better and easier option even with their dysphoria.",0

There are approximately 2000 species of true water beetles native to lands throughout the world.

Many water beetles carry an air bubble, called the elytra cavity, underneath their abdomens, which provides an air supply, and prevents water from getting into the spiracles. Others have the surface of their exoskeleton modified to form a plastron, or ""physical gill"", which permits direct gas exchange with the water. Some families of water beetles have fringed hind legs adapted for swimming, but most do not.

ckqoff0,GreatApes,"Purveyors of ""Black history"" make the ludicrous claim that Egypt was a Black civilization. They point to some Negroid features in the last of the Pharaohs as proof of this contention. It is indeed true that the last Pharaoh may have been part Black. At the end of 3,000 years, there might have been intrusion of some Black genes into the ruling family. That fact does not make the basis of Egyptian civilization Black anymore than Obama becoming president of the United States would make the signers of our Declaration of Independence Negroes. Black genes in the Egyptian royal family signified the end of the Egyptian civilization (just as Obama being elected president would be an epitaph for America). 


There are thousands of surviving hieroglyphics depicting the builders of the Egyptian civilization as White people (some with reddish hair and light eyes). The oldest recovered mummies show the remains to be White. Egypt had a civilization in some way reminiscent of the Old South. As the aristocratic White society of the South bought Black 
slaves from the African slavetraders, Egyptian Whites brought Black slaves up for labor from the lower Nile. Over thousands of years licit and illicit sexual contact between the races eventually carried Black genes even into the royal family. The completion of that process coincided perfectly with the demise of the longest enduring set of dynasties the world has ever seen and the collapse of the Egyptian civilization. 


Egypt today has a varied population, from the purest of Blacks to a vast mixed population and even a small White minority. The lighter elements are the educational, scientific, political, and business elite. 


Few peoples have fallen as far as the once great Egyptians have. The Egyptian nation is one of the poorest on Earth, with rampant poverty and crime. There are an estimated 60,000 street beggars in Cairo alone, and thousands of infants are purposely blinded or crippled and put on the street to beg, filling the coffers of cruel masters.

etoidy7,The_Europe," 

A  new scientific study could bust wide open deeply flawed fundamental   assumptions underlying controversial climate legislation and   initiatives such as the Green New Deal, namely, the degree to which   'climate change' is driven by natural phenomena vs. man-made issues   measured as carbon footprint. **Scientists in Finland found ""practically no anthropogenic \[man-made\]** **climate change"" after a series of studies.** 

&gt;“During the last hundred years the temperature increased about 0.1°C because of carbon dioxide. **The human contribution was about 0.01°C**”, the Finnish researchers bluntly state in [one among a series](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00165.pdf) of papers.

This has been **collaborated by a team at Kobe University in Japan,** which has furthered the Finnish researchers' theory: *""New   evidence suggests that high-energy particles from space known as   galactic cosmic rays affect the Earth's climate by increasing cloud   cover, causing an 'umbrella effect',""* the just published study has found, a summary of which has been released in the journal [*Science Daily*](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190703121407.htm). The findings are hugely significant given this 'umbrella effect' *—* an entirely natural occurrence *—* could be **the prime driver of climate warming, and not man-made factors**. 

The  scientists involved in the study are most concerned with the fact  that  current climate models driving the political side of debate, most   notably the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) climate   sensitivity scale, fail to incorporate this crucial and potentially   central variable of increased cloud cover. 

""The  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has discussed  the  impact of cloud cover on climate in their evaluations, but this   phenomenon has never been considered in climate predictions due to the   insufficient physical understanding of it,"" comments Professor Hyodo in [*Science Daily*](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190703121407.htm).   ""This study provides an opportunity to rethink the impact of clouds on   climate. When galactic cosmic rays increase, so do low clouds, and  when  cosmic rays decrease clouds do as well, **so climate warming may be caused by an opposite-umbrella effect**.""

In their related paper, [aptly titled](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00165.pdf),   “No experimental evidence for the significant anthropogenic \[man-made\]   climate change”, the Finnish scientists find that low cloud cover **""practically"" controls global temperatures** but that ***“only a small part”*** *of the increased carbon dioxide concentration is anthropogenic*, or caused by human activity. 

The following is a key bombshell section in one of the studies conducted by Finland's [Turku University team](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00165.pdf): 

&gt;We  have proven that the GCM-models used in IPCC report AR5 cannot  compute  correctly the natural component included in the observed global   temperature. The reason is that the models fail to derive the influences   of low cloud cover fraction on the global temperature. **A too small natural component results in a too large portion for the contribution of the greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.**   That is why 6 J. KAUPPINEN AND P. MALMI IPCC represents the climate   sensitivity more than one order of magnitude larger than our sensitivity   0.24°C. **Because the anthropogenic  portion in the increased CO2  is less than 10 %, we have practically no  anthropogenic climate change.  The low clouds control mainly the global  temperature.**

This  raises urgent questions and central contradictions regarding  current  models which politicians and environmental groups across the  globe are  using to push radical economic changes on their countries'  populations.

Conclusions  from both the Japanese and Finnish studies strongly  suggest, for  example, that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's ""drastic  measures to cut  carbon emissions"" which would ultimately require [radical legislation changes to](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/07/691997301/rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-releases-green-new-deal-outline) ***""remake the U.S. economy""*** would not   only potentially bankrupt everyone but simply wouldn't even work, at   least according to the new Finnish research team findings. 

To put AOC's ""drastic measures"" in perspective *—* based entirely on the fundamental assumption of the monumental and disastrous impact of human activity on the climate  *—* consider the following [conclusions from the Finnish studies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00165.pdf): 

&gt;*“During the last hundred years the temperature increased about 0.1°C because of carbon dioxide.* ***The human contribution was about 0.01°C.****”*

Which leads the scientists to state further:

&gt;“Because the anthropogenic portion in the increased carbon dioxide is less than 10 percent, **we have practically no anthropogenic climate change**,” the researchers concluded.

And  the team in Japan has called for a total reevaluation of current   climate models, which remain dangerously flawed for dismissing a [crucial variable](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190703121407.htm): 

&gt;**This study provides an opportunity to rethink the impact of clouds on climate.**   When galactic cosmic rays increase, so do low clouds, and when cosmic   rays decrease clouds do as well, so climate warming may be caused by an   opposite-umbrella effect. **The  umbrella effect caused by galactic  cosmic rays is important when  thinking about current global warming as  well as the warm period of the  medieval era.**

Failure to account for this results in the following, according to the one in the series of [studies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00165.pdf):   ""The IPCC climate sensitivity is about one order of magnitude too  high,  because a strong negative feedback of the clouds is missing in  climate  models.""

""If we pay attention to the fact that only a small part of the increased CO2 concentration is anthropogenic, ***we have to recognize that the anthropogenic climate change does not exist in practice***,"" the researchers conclude. 

Though we doubt the ideologues currently pushing to radically remake the American economy through what ends up being **a $93 trillion proposal** (according to [one study](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/green-new-deal-would-cost-93-trillion-or-600g-per-household-study-says)) *—* including AOC's call for a whopping 70% top tax rate *—* will carefully inquire of this new bombshell scientific confirmation presented in [the new research](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2043889198_Jyrki_Kauppinen),   we at least hope the US scientific community takes heed before it's  too  late in the cause of accurate and authentic science that would  stave  off irreparable economic disaster that would no doubt ripple  across the  globe, adding to both human and environmental misery.

cs8gvqr,marriedredpill,"&gt; I see my wife for what she really is for the first time in my life, and I've accepted her as such. 

What the fuck are you seeing.  AWALT?  Like what?  That they make mistakes when they are teenagers??  A**HUMANS**ALT!!

&gt; Trust me man, I see how this looks as others are seeing it as a betrayal that should end the relationship no matter when it occurred.

Why isn't anybody recognizing the fact that she has been faithful for 9 years of marriage?  Plus the fact that you weren't even married when she cheated.  Because that doesn't fit into the pre-conceived AWALT notion?  To me, the fact that she has been faithful for 9 years is FAR more important part than she fucked up when she was a kid.

Anyways, you sound like you have evaluated the situation correctly and you are keeping her in your life, which is great.  I'd just recommend for seeing her for what she **REALLY** is.  A faithful and loving wife, not seeing her as she **WAS**, a cheating teenage girlfriend.","Keeping a secret for nine years is not being faithful. It's daily bald faced lieing by omission, so no, she shouldn't be getting ""credit"". With cheating, many people would say the sex isn't half as bad as the deception and lies that are pure and unadulterated selfishness.

There were plenty of opportunities where a person of conscience would have spoken up. Like when the man she betrayed proposed marriage, out when she stood in front of God and family to take vows. To give credit for nine years of good behavior without taking into account the daily lies is ridiculous one-itis (not by OP).",0

* Has a career and/or proud of his work (not just a dead-end job with no aspirations of bettering himself)
* Lives on his own or is actively working towards that goal.  I understand that it's very common (and a good idea!) these days to live with family or roommates in early 20's to save money.  But independence and self-sufficiency are important traits.
* Plans &amp; pays for the first date.  However, I would also be wary of a man who spends lavishly on the first date.  Shows that he may not be financially responsible (even if he's well paid), or trying too hard to impress you and get something out of you.
* Honest and upfront with his intentions.  Lets you know what he thinks of you and where he wants the relationship to go early on (AKA not you asking the ""what are we?"" question).  As a man, he should fairly quickly know if he wants to lock you into an exclusive relationship, and take action on doing that.
* Speaks highly on family values unprompted.  This can be him wishing for children or just appreciating his family/parents.  Again, this is *unprompted*, not responding from you asking.  I understand if this doesn't immediately come up on the first date tho :)

d3bjfge,Mr_Trump,"You are absolutely right. Getting a new IP can be easy for people in the know. When SRS started this behavior 8 years ago it was harder to change IP's and IIRC most people used VPNs. I even said that it's hard to overcome an IP ban and it is wrong for me to say that.  I really rushed this whole thing and I am not a writer :(

VPN's were not perfect either.  The bottom line is that VPNs, even chained VPNs, cannot provide strong anonymity. At best they can provide obscurity. Users can be identified with meta data, and then the whole block of IP's is banned.  That way you can keep shifting through IP's trying to circumvent the ban and will fail.  Not every mod is an IT geek and many will fail to suspect this.

The duration of the operation is only 48 hours for bait, trolling and shilling.  The hard-ops window for the takeover is 8 hours, usually done at night (just like with trump, it happened at night).  So most mods will not notice and if they do they can come back soon enough. Admins will call it a mistake and the mod will believe it. If you are CIS or the head mod and this happens to you there is no direct indication that the reason you cannot log in is because of an IP ban.  Not all mods are technically savvy and SRS is standing ready to downvote and deride anyone who wants to tattle on the operation.  The information is swept under the rug from the beginning.  That way when the mod makes it back the subreddit has already been slandered and the trust in that mod has already waned.  Even when SRS fails they gain some public opinion, there are always spoils for failure in this setup.

Even if CIS knew and made a new account to get in contact he would be limited to PM's to avoid being banned again.  On an unrelated note I'd like to see him make a blog post so we can get some confirmation. Someone must be in contact with him.",Getting a new ip address was not any harder 8 years ago. ,0

Are you serious? That is exactly how Average Joe takes a share of the blame. You cannot see the cage that binds us, you consider it just Normal Reality...and therefore it's not a problem? Because you haven't experienced it, day in day out, in ways that make you feel powerless, does *not* mean it doesn't exist. You're being like a person with 20/20 vision, saying that no one needs glasses. **It is because of patriarchy that those psychopaths make it to power!** What traits has society largely upheld as signs of being successful, capable of handling leadership? Ruthlessness, talking loud and often, going in for the kill on a deal, grabbing the opponent by the balls and twisting till you get your way...you know, all that shit we mean when we talk about toxic masculinity. If women had not been kept in the home, birthing babies that take the man's name, cooking and cleaning and finance balancing as a full time job without pay for all but the last 60 or 70 years...**how much further would we be as a society?** How many bright female minds were never given the chance to further our technology or international affairs because they were kept out of school, trained to be a wife? Killed at birth because girl babies aren't as good as boy babies (resulting in mass kidnapping of women from neighboring countries when there aren't enough women for those precious boys to marry)? If ""feminine"" traits such as kindness, nurturing, crying, weren't considered so ""weak"", **our leaders would have had them throughout history.** And then maybe the world wouldn't be such a shit show, after years and years and *years* of male leadership. The ""boys don't cry"" attitude is the patriarchy, and a huge contributor to male violence by forcing men to live in emotional isolation. Don't confuse the fact that women can now drive and have jobs with the idea that the patriarchy doesn't exist. It isn't some big, bad, faceless man to be shot down, it is *the entire system our world was built on,* and *still delineates our social system*. I hope you see this, one day.

I never said porn only effects women negatively, plenty of personal experience with the men in my life have taught me men are suffering too. But dude. We are treated as less than human on a regular basis from our *childhoods* because of the way porn negatively effects men. It takes away their ability to empathize, see us as humans with depth, or get hard for real live women...and it leads to our abuse and murders. There's a big difference in the severity of side-affects. I personally believe that getting rid of mass porn consumption should be a top social priority, for men and women's health alike. But Jesus man, if you think that's best done by pointing out how it hurts *men* rather than women...**you are proving my point** that the patriarchy is alive and kicking. Because who cares if women are being abused daily as a result of porn? No one! Focus on how it hurts men, however, and bam: People will start to care! That's the patriarchy.

Maybe you're right in that it's the best way to get the conversation some momentum but damn dude. Knowing that porn leads to our abuse, and that no one cares about it, because said porn has contributed to the idea *people don't* even *know they have* that woman aren't people, yet the way to get men to care is to stop being mad about it, stop blaming them for our abuse and their complicit silence, and tend to their ego wounds like the nurturers we are, and then magically they will care...jesus christ on ice skates. You accuse me of tunnel vision, but I think you're being just as narrow in your vision. You say ""strong men...We're allies in the freeing of humanity"", but until those *allies* give enough fucks about humanity's abuse simply because it happens, and not because it's in tandem with how it hurts them...they aren't allies. They're people who are used to having shit their way, and won't go out of their way to help anyone otherwise.

Age 45, married 10 years, 2 kids**

I haven’t posted at all for a couple of months. I decided to get off MRP for a while and concentrate more on doing stuff instead of reading stuff. 


**STATS**

176lbs, 6ft 1”, BF = 13%

Deadlift - 275 lbs x 6
Squat - 200 lbs x 6
Bench - 140 lbs x 6

I began lifting weights in March this year. Am currently running Candito Linear Progresssion program – a 2 day Body Split, 4 days per week. Decent program – it has 2 days of heavy lifting with low reps, a rest day, then two days of lower weights with higher reps, all concentrating heavily on “The Big 3”.

Having trouble getting the weight up on my bench. I’ve plateued and will need to switch to a periodisation program if that happens again. Candito has a program just for that purpose which appears to be highly rated, so that’s Plan B. 

**Sidebar books read** – all of them at least once. 

**Current Reading** Way of the Superior Man. 2nd time. Enjoying it immensely. 

**Dread Leve** Started MRP this year, so 6 months in now. On DL4




**Mission**

Business is going OK. Currently seeking out / lining up new clients for the next 6-12 months. It can be slow actually getting paid for projects, so I need to be thinking at least 2 quarters in advance. For the minute, I have work on, there’s money coming in and I’m on top of everything. 

I’m thinking ahead to my next venture. I’ve been working in the same field now for 20 years and I realise now that I don’t have the same passion for it as I once did. I feel that if I divert my talents to another (closely associated) field / fields, I will enjoy it more. There are risks and costs involved in that, so I need to think about how that might work. 

In his book, Dieda recommends – when it comes to your career – to face your fears and “honor your edge” . I see his point. I also see the practical need to earn a living – which I can do with my current business – but I still see his point. It’s made me think a lot the last few days. 

**Music**

Songwriting. I dropped the ball on this entirely for over two months. Spent pretty much any free time ticking off boxes on my list of maintenance works that had to be done on the house. Most of it was outside work, so I took advantage of what has been uncommonly good weather for this part of the world. They’re all done now and I picked the guitar back up again on Sunday. 

**Sex Life**

I had a dead bedroom for 10 months. I ended that in May when we were on holidays. When we got back from the break, I failed to lead again and didn’t keep the momentum going. I should’ve kept initiating regularly but didn’t push hard on this at all. I felt like things had “settled” somewhat after the last few months (which have been quite turbulent) and I took my foot off  the gas. There’s been no sex since then. Surprise, surprise.

Last week, I caught her texting another bloke. The texts were mildy flirtatious but nothing to be overly concerned about. Getting feelz / validation from him no doubt. But I was pissed about it and I confronted her about it. I told her – calmly - that this was massively disrespectful to me and that she’d crossed a boundary. 

She was fine about it for a day or two, then on Saturday, told me that she was tired of going around in circles with me and wanted to end it (the relationship). I told her that I’d help her pack her bags in the morning. 

There’s been no mention of it since and she is being pleasant but totally withdrawn physically – she’ll turn away if I try to kiss her / hug etc. I’ve been resetting daily on this – not getting butthurt – but when she “rejects” me, I dial it down and remove my attention. Not entirely, but definitely dialled down.

So, she’s back to where we were a few months ago, rejecting all physical approaches. The difference between then and now – for me – is that I’m not bothered by it. OK, that’s a bit of a lie. It bothers me slightly. It used to affect me badly. If she turned away from a kiss, I would be hurt and feel rejected (like a chick would). Now I just carry on. The stay plan is the same as the go plan. 

For the record, we were camping at a music festival two weekends ago. The guy she was texting was at the festival – a friend of our friends. He’s a party boy, alpha type. The kind of guy I was like when she met me. 

**AWALT**

Back to the festival. We didn’t have a sitter for the three nights, so I went without her on the Friday night and set up camp with our friends.

I got chatting to this chick – a petite, black haired girl in a short mini-skirt and leather jacket. She had a cool look but she talked too much at first so I wasn’t really listening to her. Of course, the less interest I showed, the more she tried to get my attention.

As the night wore on, we got close. Lots of kino, flirting, lips touching faces (as we chatted over the music) etc. etc. At one point in the night, I just switched off entirely from what she was saying. I maintained a sense of being interested and listening – so she kept talking – but I just slipped into a sort of state of conciousness where I “felt” her presence, her beauty, her sexuality. It was a strange and very sensual feeling. OK, I was also a bit high, but it was a great moment. 

She met her childhood sweetheart when she was 17 and married him – not sure when but she’s 35 now. She barely mentioned him all night other than to say “he’s the only guy I’ve ever been with – I’m not sure what that makes me?”

“Inexperienced” was the answer I gave her, with a wink. 

We spent pretty much the whole night together, I got her number and said I’d call her for a date. I don’t plan on doing so, but I enjoyed the night. I don’t see it as validation but it was nice to have some female attention like that again. It’s been a while. 

**Feedback from last OYS** 

Again, I got some great feedback from my last OYS. Part of me wanted to post more in the last few weeks just to get some feedback / insights from other posters, but I decided that the need to just go and do stuff and try to figure things out more through actions was the best course of action.

In terms of Dread Levels, I think it’s time to move past DL4 but I’m a bit unsure. I had planned to spend another month at this but how can you train someone’s reactions to their rejections if you can’t even get passed a kiss, let alone onto an initiation? 

I should really know the answer to this. I’ve been here before. Just keep lifting, STFU and stick to the MAP. 


**Edit** 

I wrote this post an hour ago, posted it up, re-read it a couple of times and it made me realise a few things:

I have lost sight of the big picture and the small picture.

In terms of the big picture, I have spent the last 6 months working on things that I can improve now. I've done alright on that front. Not going to back slap myself but the changes I've made in my life have been significant. However, by concentrating on the ""now"", I've allowed myself too much to get dragged into the moment and forget that the bigger picture is about who I want to become, what I want to be doing, where I want to be in the future - 5, 10, 15, 20 years from now. The things I want to work towards and how I'm going to get there. 

In terms of the smaller picture, I'm 6 months into my MAP, so I'm halfway through the process.

I have 6 months of hard work left to do. When I get frustrated with her, I need to remember that she is the vessel. I need to keep my pride in check. Don’t give in to anger or emotion. 

Focus instead on your mission and your goals. I spent a good 10 years fucking up my own marraige and I need to give it the full year to try and unfuck it. And before anyone says it - yes I do realise that fixing the man and not the is the point of this - you know what I'm trying to say. 

Phew. That's been cathartic. :)

cg3g2dq,PussyPass,"&gt; Of course men are predisposed to more risk-taking behavior naturally, so there will always be more male criminals.

You're actually (whether you realize it or not) falling into the same trap.

This mentality/bias that women/men have a disparate tendency towards what is considered ""crime"" is actually a fairly recent one (historically speaking) -- and for the most part hinges on the subjective definition of ""crime"".

There may be some distinctions/differences in the TYPES of crimes that men will commit versus women, but I think that fundamentally the general *rates* of criminality are essentially identical. (And [the OLD historical data backs that up](http://www.hum.leiden.edu/history/research/projects-mgi/crime-and-gender.html).)

The distortion comes in because the *same* acts, when done by different genders -- are viewed entirely differently.  

Perhaps one of the best examples of this RIDICULOUS bias would be the case a few years ago where three older teenage girls stalked an 11 year old boy, tackled him, held him down, stripped him naked and abused his genitals, while videoing the entire thing and then uploading it to Youtube: no charges were even filed.

Flip the genders.

There is simply NO WAY that three older teenage boys would be viewed as ""having innocent fun"" if they stalked an 11 year old girl, tackled, stripped her naked and abused her genitals, while videoing it and uploading it to the internet. The boys would probably be lucky to **not** be literally *lynched* (and instead merely prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to a decades plus of imprisonment as ""dangerous sex offenders"").

Even though the incidents are related as having been IDENTICAL. The *only* thing having been changed is the genders; and of course the perceived (imputed) ""motives"".

This is especially noticeable when it comes to child abuse (sexual, physical, and psychological/emotional) -- in the ""modern"" era FEMALES are now (although NOT historically) seen as virtually ""incapable"" of abusing children (*any* children mind you, not just their own). **The plain fact of the matter is that women abuse children FAR MORE OFTEN than men do (and not merely in sheer numbers, but actually at far higher rates)** -- it just goes ""unseen"" in our modern world because: a) the majority of the abuse happens within the home; b) the victims are nearly always ""capture bonded"" to their female caretaker/abuser; and c) the outsiders have a prejudice that (almost literally) ""blinds"" them to anything but the most egregious abuse (and then, as you have noted, attribute it to ""mental illness"", which is a convenient way of reinforcing the prejudice).","&gt; The plain fact of the matter is that women abuse children FAR MORE OFTEN than men do (and not merely in sheer numbers, but actually at far higher rates)

es4zbdh,WatchRedditDie,I'll upvote you buddy. True freedom is letting people do and say what they want even if you don't like it. As long as no actual violence occurs words should never be a reason to punish people. It's asinine.,"&gt;Permissible restrictions on expression

&gt;Despite the broad freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment, there are some historically rooted exceptions. First, the government may generally restrict the time, place, or manner of speech, if the restrictions are unrelated to what the speech says and leave people with enough alternative ways of expressing their views. Thus, for instance, the government may restrict the use of loudspeakers in residential areas at night, limit all demonstrations that block traffic, or ban all picketing of people’s homes.

&gt;Second, a few narrow categories of speech are not protected from government restrictions. The main such categories are incitement, defamation, fraud, obscenity, child pornography, fighting words, and threats. As the Supreme Court held in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), the government may forbid “incitement”—speech “directed at inciting or producing imminent lawless action” and “likely to incite or produce such action” (such as a speech to a mob urging it to attack a nearby building). But speech urging action at some unspecified future time may not be forbidden.

&gt;Defamatory lies (which are called “libel” if written and “slander” if spoken), lying under oath, and fraud may also be punished. In some instances, even negligent factual errors may lead to lawsuits. Such exceptions, however, extend only to factual falsehoods; expression of opinion may not be punished even if the opinion is broadly seen as morally wrong.

&gt;Fighting words—defined as insults of the kind likely to provoke a physical fight—may also be punished, though general commentary on political, religious, or social matters may not be punished, even if some people are so upset by it that they want to attack the speaker. Personalized threats of illegal conduct, such as death threats, may also be punished.

Exceptions to the First Amendment of the US constitution. So, no you can't just say anything you want and have people accept it. If you insult people to their face, expect repercussions.",2

c5zx7vm,new_right,"Fun theory. This would explain Ted Kaczynski. [He's rugged and handsome, but he does look like a Neanderthal man.](http://www.biography.com/imported/images/Biography/Images/Profiles/K/Ted-Kaczynski-578450-1-420.jpg) Have you ever noticed how eccentric white males in general look more like Neanderthals than other males?

&gt;As usual, she couldn't read the warning look on my face. ""The hybridization was successful in the Stone Age, but the environment has changed. I found that modern culture selects for socialization but against the Neanderthal traits for mathematics and intelligence,"" she said, and looked down. ""I don't know how you'll survive when our genes are gone.""

Today social people survive best. The Neanderthal in us wants to recreate the hunter gatherer conditions in which he evolved.

Low population densities, cold climate, and no multi-culti feel good ""we are all equal"" leftism which Sapiens thrive best in.

Thanks to assortative mating, Neanderthal genes are being reintroduced to each other. Hence autism becomes more common every generation. Nerds breed with nerds, in a subconscious attempt to bring back their Neanderthal ancestor who was raped and exterminated by our friendly African Homo Sapiens Sapiens who came to Europe to enrich our monocultural Neanderthal environment.

You could even argue our culture maintains some tradition of this hybrid origin of our people. Hence we come up with dwarves and elves, exaggerated versions of Neanderthals and Sapiens. Shorter and sturdier eccentric men with beards, versus taller more gracile and youthful looking beings.

I like to think that the collapse of civilization will gradually allow Neanderthal man to re-emerge from his descendants, as the environment once again begins to resemble the environment in which he evolved. If he was alive today, he would recognize us as his children, and expect us to purge the Sapiens element from our blood. 

My suggestion is: To help our chances of survival, resurrect the mammoth.

From now on, the 14 words shall be:

""We must secure the re-emergence of our species and a future for Neanderthal children.""","&gt;Fun ~~theory~~story.

There is no such things as ""straight clubs"", because bars and clubs can't descriminate against your sexual orientation.

h7ebrlu,Egalitarianism,Do women generally have it harder in society? ,"I’d say that heavily depends on the society you are considering. I’m a guy, but in my opinion it seems pretty close in the US with each side having difficulties in different aspects in life. However, I’d consider it tipped towards some women having it significantly tougher solely due to abortion laws which can really ruin women’s futures with the closest life/future-ruining equivalents that come to mind on the male side being losing in family courts more often and the harsher criminal sentencing on average. Once abortion rights are settled though, I’d say it would be leaning towards men having it tougher thanks to all the great progress women’s groups have made in bettering the female experience.",0

In a way Adam reminds me of that friend who needs to crash on your couch for a month. Week one he's super appreciative and going out of the way to help and be respectful. Week two it wears off. Week three he's in command of your living room and having company 6 nights a week. Week four you're wondering what you got yourself into, and that's when he tells you he needs another month. 

Not the perfect metaphor, but an example of that guy who gets too comfy too soon in a space that's not really his. Apparently Tim is still letting Adam do his podcast out of his studio.

Ain’t being gay only a choice of companion? Then why do people change their identity? You’re not a gay teacher, you’re a teacher who prefers the companion of men that’s a private thing keep it to yourself don’t have a flag for it, it’s the whole black lives matter bullshit all over again, you’re not solving anything by creating a flag or having a pride month just be gay in your own life don’t shove it in our face, it’s not even about gay or lesbian, if a vegan tries to do the same and have a flag I’ll hate them too, be who ever the fuck you want to be just don’t shove it in our face with flags and movies, I was a very very hardcore feminist one day but when I see that feminism has turned in to a fight against men I hate it, feminism isn’t a fight against men it should be fight against society for being sexist in so many ways, the twitter trend #Allmenaretrash that’s not what I support

Trust me I know how gay people feel I don’t think they shouldn’t be able to be with each other I’m just against the idea of it having such big impact on children and young generation

Edit: updated","I think I’m actually seeing your point. Many of the supposed “movements” that are going on aren’t positively contributing to obtaining rights for a minority group, but are, instead, creating a weird identity-based culture that seems very exclusive to people not of that identity.

I think that’s a perfectly fair perception to have.

Here’s the thing though: some of these movements might not be operated in the best way, just like how BlackLivesMatter is giving people such bad perception. Does that mean you necessarily HAVE to disagree with their motives?

Taking BlackLivesMatter as an example, does disagreeing with the way they operate mean that you have to disagree with their motive to give black people equal rights? Surely not.

I see the frustration, but I think it’s important to recognize that not all homosexual people are part of shallow identity-based movements, and the ones you don’t see truly just want a normal life like everyone else WITH the rights everyone else has.",0

gte65yh,Egalitarianism,"I mean if your only goals under egalitarianism is to remove circumstances where women have an advantage without also addressing domestic violence rates, murder by partner, wage gap, yeah you are gonna look like an Incel MRA chud","It's pretty damn close actually. [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/05/men-victims-domestic-violence](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/05/men-victims-domestic-violence)

There's more evidence all over but experts state it's about equal. The only difference is men are generally ignored at best and more likely to be accused as the aggressor anyways even when they don't defend themselves. It's a major issue. 

The gap has been disproven countless times, not sure why you're bringing that up. Which is why egalitarianism doesn't talk about it at all, because it's basically seen as the flat earth idea of the political landscape. Proven false countless times, yet still believed by many. I'm not even going to give a link for this one due to how easy it is to find dozens of studies on how it doesn't really exist when you bring in job differences, overtime, experience and haggling for raises which men are just better at the latter due to being naturally less agreeable. 

Also calling everyone Incel MRA chuds to those you disagree with is a real easy way to invalidate what you're talking about. Ad-hominens help no one's points. At best it pushes people away that would of been opening to talk and at worst it spreads that mindset to others and just makes everyone more aggressive and less open minded. 

Egalitarianism is about getting rid of all the circumstances where others are above the other sex. Thing is, the most important part is start with the systems in place that are systemic, and women are generally treated superior when it comes to that, where women are more equally screwed over is when we talk about social issues. Which are certainly apart of the discussion and should be talked about. Which is where murder by partner rates come in as it's not like those men aren't going to get hit by the law generally speaking, which makes it at most a social issue, a very extreme one, but one none the less. Though one could argue also that it's just a screwed up man and less a social issue. You're not going to teach criminals to stop being criminals, and murderers are murderers because of their own character, not because of a lack of being taught murder is bad and being a man.",0
dmlz1tp,NationalSocialism,"Hello there. You might not have seen my comments on here before but you're going to get used to me in the near future. Why? Because I'm going to make this subreddit a living hell for you to be in. You're not kind to anyone who is not White, Christian, Conservative, Straight, and Pro-Trump. So I'm not going to be kind to you. But where to start? I have so many things I would like to get off my chest. You know what, let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am mixed-race (75% White, 25% Asian), I am an agnostic atheist, I am a liberal, I am queer (in my case, leaning towards gay), and I am Anti-Trump. Now I'll find out the things we have in common with each other. I tolerate the existence of school vouchers, I am against safe spaces and trigger warnings (A study conducted by psychologists shows that they don't work), I am a supporter of a balanced federal budget, and, although it's not perfect, I believe capitalist economics is slightly superior to that of socialist economics. I use the word ""liberal"" somewhat loosely here as the international definition of it states that they favor less restrictions on both social and economic affairs. You may claim to believe the same thing if I had not told you the definition of a liberal. Don't you find it strange that despite the fact you claim that members of the political establishment are the ""real authoritarians"", their beliefs are anarchist compared to yours? Think about it. They want women to make their own reproductive choices. You want the government to take that away from them. They want minorities to be free to use whatever facilities they want and to to follow their passions. You want the government to take that away from them. They want LGBTQIA individuals to be free to love each other. You want the government to enforce laws that will jail them. They want the population to practice whatever beliefs they wish. You want the government to enforce your values and your values alone. Now compare your beliefs to that of the political establishment's and answer this question: Who are the real authoritarians? If you still believe that the political establishment is as authoritarian as you say it is, please explain why. I guess I'll be going now. I'll be to play some more games with you soon.

I tried to be a little less red-pilly during this pregnancy, but today I put my foot down (calmly) and said it's starting to affect our baby and the weight she's putting on now will only be harder to burn off after the baby is born.  I'm just at a loss on what to do.  I tried doing the whole supportive thing for a few months, but my inner redpill kept yelling at me to be upfront with her.  How do I get through to her?

c8ht9u4,new_right,"1) What aristocracy?

2) Assuming this idealistic notion - or even not when it comes to countries such as your own (I am right in thinking you're American yes?), how would you create an aristocracy or define one if one cannot be created?

3) History does not particularly support the notion that the aristocracy is inherently so intertwined with the ""preservation and health of the nation"" - after all the very notion of nation states as we know of them today are a response of the (bourgeoisie) people against the idea of the land as something which belongs to kings and nobles and into something defined by the culture (and often language) of ""the people"".

I come representing the Vanguard, a party unique to MHoC. We are a rather loose grouping of the alternative right, united by our desire to defend the British national identity, and the traditions that are the expression of that identity.

As well as a general slide to the liberal left, UKIP have now on MHoC decided to support reform of the EU over exit, making the Vanguard the only party on the right to support leaving the EU.

I'm Rlack, the Independent Candidate for Kent &amp; East Sussex, and I'm asking for your helping hand in my bid to win this seat. I am running on a sort of ""Patriotic Socialist"" platform - don't be misled, I don't blindly follow the real ideology of the real party, and I am not simply a diluted National Socialist (despite how hilarious that would be. I am simply a Socialist that realises the importance of national identity and a common brotherhood uniting the people of a nation - core principles, ideals and ideas that we must defend and uphold.

I have chosen to run as an independent because the conventional left have consistently failed to realise this reality, consistently failed to defend Britain; the modern left breeds a peculiar contempt for the idea of ""nationality"" and the common identity that binds us together, and have instead perpetrated a destructive erosion of these core principles in favour of a cold, faceless and characterless Britain. This societal emptiness appears to be prevalent across all of the mainstream left, only becoming more depressingly apparent the further left you go. This consensus of the left to act against the acts of the British cultural identity must be overcome, and I represent that alternative. A vote for /u/Rlack is a vote for an altruistic Britain, caring for one another, increasing workplace democracy for all involved, whilst never forgetting that one of the key uniting elements of life is one that cannot be codified or rationally summarised, but is the national spirit, pride &amp; patriotism that brings the people of Britain and towards a common goal.

Sadly, I live in a state where they won't even let you into a store without a mask, and have gargoyles whose only job it is is to stop people from entering without masks, so I have to comply indoors. Except in the occasional based stores. Technically they made it ""required"" to wear mask outdoors, too, but fuck that. I ignored everything until they summoned the gargoyles. Continued to ignore everything, until they removed all exemptions.

f6oi5qy,Ask_Radical_Feminists,"I think such a situation would rely on there being no sex inequality or poverty. Even if that were the case, I'm not sure if it's possible for it to be totally ethical with money involved. Because if the participants don't need the money, and they're doing the sex work because they enjoy it, why aren't they just recording their sex and putting it online independently without payment? Why are they seeking payment? Who's paying them? Surely the person providing the money has some preferences about how the scene should go, whether it's a director telling you to do anal or a fad among cam viewers that will get you more money if you comply.

In the most hypothetical situation where you have sex 100% on your terms and also get some cash as a bonus, I don't think it's inherently harmful. But when there's money involved, I don't think it's possible for a power imbalance to be absent. ""Sex + money"" ignores the context of there being someone who pays you, who inevitably has some say in what you do. Which is coercion.

There's also the impact on viewers. Hypothetically, you could only distribute porn that shows consent and mutual pleasure. But the natural human response to sexual stimuli is to seek new stimuli, which is what leads people into abusive and extreme stuff. Given how the internet enables mass consumption of stimuli, I don't know if it's possible to prevent extreme stuff from eventually becoming mainstream as it is now.

**In short:** I suspect it can only be ethical for the performers if there's no money involved, and that it's impossible to prevent the negative effect on consumers.","What about in a communist society without transfer of money? I have some libfem friends who use this argument.

I am against sex work because I don't think men will ever stop being sexist toward women... But I would like to have a more developed response.",0

dpmj2b5,WatchRedditDie,"One thing you can credit capitalism for is that it has done an amazing job at making food so inexpensive and readily available that few people risk starvation. In fact in most states with capitalist economies the real threat is that people are over-fed, and overconsumption of (often) ""low quality"" foods have led to poor health outcomes.

When you look out at the world, why there are so many people starving is because of how land has been misused in countries run by authoritarian dictatorships and socialist states. Zimbabwe was once the bread basket of Africa by Mugabe stole the land from wealthy land owners and gave it to people who couldn't manage it. Venezuela should easily be able to feed their people but can't because Chavez decided to steal the land from wealthy land owners and give it to people who couldn't manage it.

Certainly, the west has a problem with food waste but people are actively trying to solve that problem. After all in a capitalistic society reducing waste leads to greater revenues and profits.","That's not what happened. Chavez helped millions of people out of extreme poverty. Venezuella is in this state because it waggered it's entire economy on oil trade.

And most of the dictatorship you are talking about were set in place by america who'd rather have people be murdered by capitalists rather than see a socialist state.

Just see how the diamond trade operates. The palm oil operates. It destroy forest and farming land because it's cheap to mine out ores there. 

The rich land owner in Africa don't give a fuck about the population starving (i'd know, my country's billionaires are half of them), they want to create as much revenue as possible and they are ready to pay the first corrupt official to turn a blind eye on their nasty business.

&gt;After all in a capitalistic society reducing waste leads to greater revenues and profits.

This is the best joke I have heard today. Our entire economy is based on peple buy as much shit as possible. Changing phones ever year or more, single use TV that can't be repaired when they have the slightest issue. Lightbulbs that could be build to be virtually indestructible but the industry couldnt handle it because we wouldnt buy enough.

I was 17, and at first it began as a general interest in hypnosis, and I thought B**** Sleep sounded pretty hot so I committed to listening every day for about 3 months to see if it would change me (was pretty skeptical of hypnosis at all at this point).  

Other than some memory loss during some files I didn’t notice anything off or different, but then I found out there’s a subreddit for BS, I met people who would play around and trigger me and it was hot asf how much control I didn’t have in the wake. I was also talked into watching sissy hypno and captions and I soon got addicted to that as well. 

Well now it’s been 2 years, still listening to BS, and I can’t get hard to anything else anymore, only BS triggers and sissy related stuff. I used to be able to be aroused to women but not anymore. But when I do see BS triggers and sissy stuff it’s like a drug hit, I get shakes and immediate precum, but very low quality watery cum, which didn’t used to happen before.

You should NEVER be focused on her.

ihhacb2,askAGP,"what is most arousing to you **EDIT: The poll is asking if you are more aroused by being an actual woman or by being a feminized man. It is not asking what fantasy is most arousing to you [i.e. having sex with a man as a woman would be option one].  The last option is there to mean if you are not aroused by being a woman nor aroused by being a feminized man, in which case you wouldn't be AGP so the last option is ridiculous and it shouldn't even be there, really.  AGPS fall into two categories: aroused by being a woman or aroused by being an emasculated man.

ehu75qq,Homophobes,"&gt;You clearly see homosexuality as a sin or some kind of depravation. I understand that but I firmly disagree, and I think this is making it difficult for us to get to an agreement.

Which it is -- but that's NOT my point. I'm not judging your choices nor do I even care to change them. I'm simply saying live and LET LIVE. Do your own thing in your own homes, you own groups, your own mental and physical spaces. We (the other 95% of the world) aren't *obligated* to accept you. Get that through your head!

The LGBT movement is no different than any other invader.

&gt;whatever your vision on homosexuality is it is nothing compared to any kind of actual child abuse.

Indoctrinating children to *accept* depravity as ""normal"", immorality as ""lifestyle"", decadence as ""choice"", violence as ""social justice"", to demand ""pan-acceptance"" from everyone, and to do so **against parental opposition** is every bit as much child abuse as Hitler Jugend.

See: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDMu4QylVRQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDMu4QylVRQ)

&gt;We never killed anyone for not accepting us.

You are clearly someone young and completely ignorant of how these things unfold. The tallest tree was born of the smallest seed.

&gt;I had no idea about the school thing. So we did take some extreme ways to get acceptance.

""No idea"" is your problem. You didn't gain ""acceptance"". That's an illusion. The LGBT movement has *indoctrinated* people into regurgitating  scripted contrived ""morality"" and pseudo-science, much like you've been doing for a large part of this exchange. 

But the world majority is against you. Russia (a nation of almost 150 Million) just banned any forms of LGBT propaganda. The African continent has anti-LGBT laws in 36 out of 54 countries. LGBT movement is wholesale banned from the ENTIRE Muslim world (that's over 1.3 BILLION people --- with the highest global birth rates. And China is actively working to censor LGBT-related information on its web ([https://www.thedailybeast.com/china-keeps-trying-to-scrub-lgbt-content-from-the-web](https://www.thedailybeast.com/china-keeps-trying-to-scrub-lgbt-content-from-the-web)). 

So while the LGBT movement has certainly wreaked havoc on western societies, it has certainly not achieved ""acceptance"" by any stretch of the imagination. ","If we go by your point of view then we need to say; ""We support LGBT but we see Jews as invaders to our economy and we aren't *obligated* to accept that little minority taking control of us, Heil Hitler!""

you do realize that while tipping is now considered the norm, it makes like zero sense. i paid for my food, why would i pay you a few bucks just for walking to my table form the kitchen? while it is only a few dollars, you have to realize that minimum wage is about 7.50/hr depending on where you live. if you're working off of tips, thats like 3 trips to a table. if you work at a semi-nice restaurant, thats 2 trips. that takes you way less than an hour.

I don't bitch about my tips, I average between 19-20% consistently because I bust my ass, but if someone comes in and purposely tips 0% based simply off of something that isn't remotely related to my service I am going to be pissed. We can all enjoy the low food costs because restaurant businesses pay their employees shit with the assumption the customers will compensate the servers appropriately. When people don't tip this system fails and it just pisses off the people who bring you your food. I am all for increasing the pay of servers. ""Minimum wage"" for servers was set in 1991 and it has gone up for the rest of workers 50% since then but ours hasn't changed.

I used to think if I lost weight and looked like \[insert popular celebrity here\] I would be the life of the party, have lots of friends, and everything would be right in the world. I did lose the weight. I got braces. I started doing my hair and dressing better and doing my nails.  I got into a top school and got a good job. By all measures, I was a ""catch""- but I  didn't have any big party invites, no lineup of gentleman callers, just a small group of friends. Know why?

**Because my attitude and social skills hadn't improved.** Being overweight before wasn't the issue, feeling uncomfortable and awkward in my own skin because I wasn't taking care of myself was.  I didn't have cool hobbies to share, or interests outside of netflix and hitting up the occasional bar. I didn't put myself out there, and I looked unapproachable and I hadn't developed myself enough to feel confident that I had something to share or offer to others.

It sounds like your sister is more outgoing, and that may be why she's getting more attention. Yes, looks are important on a superficial level, and yes it's flattering,but it gets very old very fast. If you don't have any substance to back it up all you'll end up with is a bunch of douches vying for ONS.

**What do** ***you*** **have to offer? What makes you fun, interesting, or special? What are some topics that make you light up about? Play that shit up and own it. Focus on that and attraction and confidence will come to you later naturally.**

That was the turning point for me. Now I focus a lot on my own interests, I have an active personal life that is intriguing to others and satisfying to me. I travel as much as I can, I have a good job that I enjoy, I take care of myself, and I have plenty to talk about. I did a two month trip to Europe this year,  I learned how to ride a motorcycle, I skateboard, I go to lots of shows and I have people over to my house (which I keep clean, comfortable, and welcoming) for potluck dinners that everyone enjoys and wants to be a part of (because I took the time to learn how to cook). I am outgoing, I listen to others, and I always smile and introduce myself when I meet someone new.

None of that just happened and none of it has anything to do with being pretty. I get hit on a lot and it's because of how i make people feel, they want to be around me because I work hard to be the person others want to be around. I am not boasting, I know these are facts because I have put in a lot of time and effort to come out of my shell and find these things that I like doing and to make it so.

Having geeky interests isn't a problem, eventually you'll see those are all just a bunch of made up judgments anyway. It's part of you so play it up. I was into biblical anointing oils for awhile but I would light up when I talked about them so people listened. When you light up, others will too. An average girl who is it lit up is more attractive than a conventionally pretty girl with a scowl. Right now you need to build up yourself so you know what those things are and can develop them. This is an absolute imperative that extends far beyond hooking up, you need to know this so you can be fulfilled in yourself, for yourself, and will help immensely as you get older.

I can go on forever about this but it is such a huge topic there's no way I could do it in one reddit post. There's a great book called ""The New Rules of Attraction"" by Arden Leigh and it helped me a lot. I think when you start to understand what attraction is really about this will be much easier for you. Your sister isn't the issue, she is just bringing the issue to the surface. I know this sucks right now but if you go about it the right way you will learn invaluable lessons that will take you down a beautiful path.

Ultimately you're the one driving this train and if you want things to change to you have to change them. Nobody can help you if you aren't going out to help yourself. Good luck to you and feel free to ask if you have any questions. xo",0

g7c8rwd,HeckOffCommie,"Don't twist Christianity to your own ends - Marx called religion 'the opiate of the people', the soviet communists nailed priests to the doors of their churches during the revolution.

And the rich can get to heaven if they're not attached to their wealth. As seen in the story of Job (OT) and other saints, however a lot of the time riches do corrupt the soul, and so it is 'harder for a rich man to enter heaven than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle'

Heck Off Commie","""Soviet Communists"" If you want to have a real discussion then let's talk real ideology, not strawmen. The Soviets *were not* communist, the workers never owned the means of production, it was at best an authoritarian capitalist hellscape, and so using the methods they used as an example is disingenuous at best. 

As you correctly pointed out, Marx called religion the 'opiate of the people' because at the time it was used by the churches of the largest denominations to tell the poor that although they suffered now, they should be content so they would be rewarded in heaven. Some denominations still do this, but the idea of religion is not considered an opiate on its own to any leftists I know personally.

Also, yes, the fact that it's harder for a rich man to enter heaven than a camel to go through the eye of a needle is exactly what was said in the Bible, but I'd ask you to think more analytically about why it is that being rich and going into heaven is nearly (or perhaps fully, depending on how you interpret the metaphor) impossible for a rich man. Is it because rich men become rich because they are attached to money, or because they somehow become rich by accident and then become attached to money?

Christ teaches that human suffering is unjust, and that causing it goes against the will of God, so are hoarders of wealth going against the will of God by allowing their fortunes to become more important than human suffering? I'd argue so, and I don't see much of an argument against it.

chyav8n,masculism,"Let's talk about penis size I feel driven to post this, because there are a lot of questions about penis size - really, everywhere - and I feel like for all the questions, most of them don't quite hit the mark.

The question almost every guy posts at some point in his life is ""How big is big enough?"" - specifically, ""what pleases a woman?"" Some of the answers approach the question correctly - people are built differently - but others take a different route, giving direct answers based on individual preferences. And then the woman who says she likes big penises is shamed out of the discussion, while people remark with statements like, ""Wow, you're a size queen"" or ""You must have a really saggy/loose vagina"".

I'm going to ignore the fact that the looseness of a vagina is not based on how much sex a woman has had, as is the misconception, and jump to something else.

We build our self-worth on this. I've known guys with small penises who are nearly suicidal. The stereotype is that guys with large penises use it to take advantage of people or to act like... well, dicks. Sometimes, we make those guys out to be the ""alpha males,"" who are capable of having their pick of women. Some of us assume that women who say they're fine with average are simply lying.

It's time to take a serious look at how we view penis size, don't you think? Pop culture and porn - really, everything around us - are telling us that bigger is more pleasurable for every woman. In the ""Blurred Lines"" video by Robin Thicke, an excellent example of how pastiche is not the best medium for satire, ""Thicke's"" name is hashtagged throughout the video while topless women dance around him, and later around the statement ""Robin Thicke has a big dick"". You then look at many of Rihanna's songs, but especially ""Rude Boy"":

""Come on rude rude boy can you get it up
Come on rude rude boy is you big enough?""

Moreover, somebody could tell a small penis joke, and nobody would bat an eye. It's that common.

And the problem is further hammered home. But almost nobody's talking about this, possibly out of the stigma that speaking out about this sort of thing implies the system is slighting you. The implication behind complaining about this for some people, as I've seen firsthand, is that you *must* have a small penis. 

And yet, when faced with this issue, we don't talk about it. Sometimes, blame is redirected to women, but we don't really talk about how fucked up it is that we live in a world where one of the first questions of puberty is ""Do I measure up?"". And all this is for an aspect of life - penetration in sexual contact - indicating that we're further both reducing ourselves to a part of our body and our self-worth to our ability to perform in one area, where it really shouldn't matter.

So, I guess I'll ask: What do you think here? I was once called a small penis apologist for asking this question, which actually mildly offended me, because I feel like it's a perfectly valid take on a subject nobody wants to address. 

For reference, I feel this article also tackles what I'm talking about. It's sad that nothing really similar has cropped up in the two or three years since, but I actually found it very insightful.

http://www.rachelrabbitwhite.com/dont-want-no-short-dick-man-our-cultural-obsession-with-penis-size/","I find it interesting to think about how long this has been around. 

Archaeologists seem pretty set on female fertility to be associated with the Venus objects found dating back to 20 thousand years ago (if i remember correctly) but male penis size I have seen pop up (no pun intended) here and there. I see in TV shows about rome in fact I think it was called Rome a young man being introduced to brothels, but do not know where in ancient writings penis size comes up. When I think about Greek statues I do not remember these men looking like real studs too often, and a few vases just seem to have penises everywhere. I know that middle ages and the comedia del arte shows lots of penis humour as does shakespeare. 

I guess it is interesting to think about penis size in time and space IMO and where maybe the myth of the large penis being more pleasurable began, or whether it ever really was a thing pre 1950/1960

Specifically your thoughts on my opinion of the trade war? My stance is that Trump's trade decisions have reduced America's domination of global trade and just gave it to China. The reason why is because Trump runs the country like a business, but China runs their country for geopolitical domination. There are few major reasons why I believe this. 

1) Trump has put a great deal of effort into seeding distrust into the government and media. At times he is correct, liberal news can be sensationalized and their hatred towards him is often blinding. But rather than bridging the divide he has found 'triggering the libs' more enjoyable than finding common ground. I think the ensuing scandals, his fault or not, and his tweeting have taken up entire segments of the evening news and distracted from major geopolitical plays made by China under his nose. For example, their increased military presence (and for the first time ever new military bases in key trade locations) which barely even hit the news because every channel was obsessed with the funny man with blonde hair. 

2) During Trump's tenure, he ran on a incoherent policy of returning to the old world order of American isolationism and self-sufficiency. China would love nothing more than to return to the old world where it was the centre of geopolitical dominance and America wasn't included. Trump just... gave it to them. This is why I think that:

A) Trump pulled out of the Trans Pacific partnership, which gave China an opportunity to expand its influence of the Pacific. The Chinese inserted themselves into leading the negotiation for new trade treaties without ANY  Americans at the table, which is unheard of. Then at the World Economic Forum, an event hosted for the elites of global capitalism, the president of the Chinese communist state was the opening speaker. China actually lectured to the world on how to do better free trade and how his Nation would now take a leading position, while America wasn't even present.

B) Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods. Chinese goods became more expensive in the US (paid largely for by American consumers in higher prices, but reduced their demand). However, China just sold those goods to Africa at less of a cost in favour of increased relations and resources, it didn't even bump their production. But what's worse is that Chinese were still selling the same products to consumers in the United States anyway, by developing a new relationship with Vietnam and Malaysia. China would send them a 90% completed product, finish the 10%, and call it ""not made in China""; Vietnam and Malaysia previously had much stronger ties to the United States and we're wary of China (because of history), the agreement incentivize them to develop stronger economic relationship at the cost of American relations. Trump KNEW about the loophole, because it's something the US uses all the time. Cars are built to 90% completion in Mexico and shipped to the US and called ""made in USA"". Plus a million other examples to get cheaper labour, I won't bore you by listing) 

C) China has developed a lucrative trade relationship with pretty much the entirety of Africa, while trump called them shit holes and diminished America's own influence in the region from a policy perspective. Now we left Africa alone because of dictatorships etc, but they are more than happy to give China all their resources so China can produce stuff and sell it back to them. 

D) Trump then imposed tariffs on India for aluminium... The ONLY real local competitor with China for trade domination in the region. India has been increasingly cut off by the systematic building of ports by China across the middle East and africa (by lending money, them defaulting, then having to give them prime location for a China soverign port). Instead of stengthing India, he just weakened them further for no real geopolitical purpose other than a political image to his voters.

E) Trump's is hated. Like truely hated on a global scale by other world leaders. They see him as unstable and unreliable. Members of the EU have publicly stressed the economic certainty of China is more attractive than the US. They also have been bailed out by China (e.g., esp Portugal and Greece) which has influenced policy decisions that diminish the criticism of China's human rights problems and also diminish the influence of the US (not Trump's fault there). Don't even get me started on what they did to Australia... 

F) my country, Canada, Trump has reared his trade wars on and became economically unpredictable even to us. First he tried to fuck us on NAFTA for a public win, which was minor in terms of gains. During COVID trump told our ONLY DISTRIBUTOR OF N95s to stop shipping them to us, even though it's something that we are so desperately low on. Despite us being literally are 3Ms only supply of that type of pulp, he still tried to fuck us.  Who was there when we scrambled? Yes. China. In fact China, despite being the epicentre of all this, has been dishing out economic support to countries since this started. Again strengthening geopolitical dominance while Trump flounders to just sort out his country. 

China has wanted to topple US global trade domination since they came out of that terrible famine and looked back at their old world history. And I sincerely believe Trump alone hastened it significantly.

czslesk,european,"&gt;The flooding of tibet with chinese nationals is classified as genocide, this is no different. And its not just one country, every western country has been taking in thousands upon thousands of immigrants, who have been shown to be outbreeding western populations by a landslide. In 20 or 50 years, when white people are a minority in their own country what will you be saying?

So here's everything that's wrong with your argument.

1) the flooding of Tibet by Chinese nationals WAS genocide, BECAUSE it was initiated by China in an attempt to gain control over Tibet via Chinese nationals, thereby fitting the scope of DELIBERATELY inflicting conditions that are CALCULATED to do blah blah.

2) I should hopefully not have to explain the difference between accepting refugees that your infrastructure is just not ready for, and sending your own population into a country in attempt to control it ""Democratically"".

3) Define minority. Racial minority? National minority? Countries weren't meant to stay ethnically homogeneous. Other than maybe Israel. So are you claiming letting in any people outside of the majority race of that country is genocide? Did the US commit genocide by allowing black people to live there after slavery ended? Are European countries committing genocide by letting Asian people live there? Youre trying to use the word "" genocide"" to mean ""they let Muslims in"".

REALLY. You don't say. So very chill about the human rights violation of epic proportions that is being housed with the wrong ""gender"". 

Shouldn't even transwomen be out protesting this? I mean there is a very real, genuine *man* being housed in a women's prison! Danger, danger!

In all seriousness, curious how people feel here about females in women's prisons on testosterone, given evidence that it increases violent crime rate (per that Swedish study)?

I wouldn't want them in with men, obviously as it would be dangerous for them. 

But would you want them in with the rest of women, if they were continuing testosterone? Or would you want them in with women, with testosterone discontinued?

Would you advocate for something like a separate wing (something I think would be good in male prisons for GNC male prisoners as an alternative to solitary)?

Do you think they should continue hormones? I'm on the fence about this (completely opposed to surgery, but hormones, not sure?). If they quit, will that cause mental disturbances in itself from withdrawal? Like this woman says, if not on testosterone (maybe, not sure if these two things are really mutually exclusive) they would be putting her on some psych meds that would cost even more.

In general I'd like to see the medical establishment take all this more seriously, and treat people for mental illness instead of handing out hormones to start with, but until that happens, this is going to be a huge problem for prisons, one that they didn't create, so I feel pity for them for having to deal with this.","&gt;In all seriousness, curious how people feel here about females in women's prisons on testosterone, given evidence that it increases violent crime rate    

It says that criminality rises after full transition. As in, after surgeries and numerous years of transition. Although I agree that testosterone heightens your likelihood to commit violent crimes. I've been on testosterone, you're more react violently on it, especially if you don't know how to control yourself. 

However, it's also important to realize that the trans community breeds violence because of many other reasons. The community itself used to (and still does in someways) push harmful gender roles on trans men. It tells them they need to mimic toxic masculinity. After years of internalizing these messages in the hope that they'll be like ""real men"", it's no wonder they're more likely to commit violence. There's also the fact that trans men are commonly CSA victims, rape victims. Therefore more likely to be ill, more likely to be poor. Which heightens the likelyhood that they'll end up lashing out in a violent way. 

This person is young, they've not been on hormones long, not been indoctrinated for long. I don't think they're anymore likely to be a threat to the female prison population than a non-trans female who had higher than normal testosterone. ",1

Men naturally rape and pillage because testosterone

Women naturally get the vapors and faint seven times a day because estrogen

Heterosexual people have it the worst because hormones

Trans people are here to save us all!","Testosterone rage is real though, even women [experience](https://youtu.be/awTjHHwVPRQ?t=7s) it. 

FTM trans are also complaining about becoming moody, having unexplicable rage and feeling messed up while on T. The good side is that it allows you lose weight like magic and put on muscle from doing practically nothing. Overall, testosterone experience tends to be much tougher, it messes up your mood way more than estrogen. Now think that poor males have to live with this substance in their blood every single day. A healthy woman, who is not a professional athlete, has T level of a 10yo boy. I remember being 10yo. Life was better back then. And I am pretty sure FTMs detransition way more often.

When she looks me in the eye and says ""these are invitation only do you understand?""  what should I do?

I have been trying to duck and dodge - I don't want to actually agree with her.  I have mentioned something like ""your invitation was marrying me - I don't need anymore invitations!"" but she is making it feel all rapey.

g4flfho,asktrp,"My dick doesn't get hard when I feel like a girl is a whore... What the hell man. Please help? I am 100% serious. This is a tragic sad weird situation.

My dick gets hard when I interact with a girl I feel like I can trust.

My dick shrinks when I interact with a whore. 

I visited an escort today. Good reviews. Slim body, nice natural tits, bubble butt. But she was a whore and she acted like a whore. From the start I got turned off. My dick went in the opposite direction. I kid you not. She tried to get me hard in various ways but nothing worked. My biology stubbornly refused to stick my dick in her. I couldn't help it.

Here's more problems...

I believe there's no girl I can trust. Even though sometimes I feel like I can trust a girl, I then realize that's not true. Thanks to TRP and evolutionary psychology.

I am not from where you are from. To me, if a girl is not a virgin and not married, she's sort of a whore. What I mean by that is, once she fucked someone casually, then its done. I can't love or trust such a girl. My dick gets hard only for girls I love. I think.

What the fuck am I gonna do?

I'm questioning if I am addicted to porn and have ED. I'm not 100% sure but I don't think so. 

The weird thing is I am pretty horny most of the time. When I'm outside I see moderately hot girls and I just want them so much. Maybe because they seem a little out of reach, unlike a whore who sits naked in front of me? I don't get it.

Its like my dick wants to put itself into a safe and trustworthy woman I love and potentially make babies. Its fucking stupid. My brain has no power over it. What the fuck man. 

In past, I used to talk to girls more. Sometimes the girl was really attractive, smart and come from wealth. But as soon as she hints something about her past, I'd lose interest and stop talking to her. Why am I like this? Am I biologically bound to be a beta, or alone and sexually frustrated?

In another instance, I remember a girl with full of tattoos and shaved head and she turned me on a lot. She was a whore. Why did she turn me on? If she was on my bed, was I gonna be turned off?

What I really want is someone I can trust, hug and you know have a life with but I don't think that exists. If I go that route, I'm going to get fucked eventually and I'm 99.9% sure of that. But I guess I want that due to bad childhood.

I'm going to find the best looking, most talented and expensive escort here this week and month. If that doesn't work, I think I'm fucked. Who am I going to fuck? I am sexually frustrated but I apparently don't want to get a hard on to fuck a nice body!!","I'm the opposite, the whores get me rock hard.",0

e3rk4p2,AganistGayMarriage,"I am not against gay marriage specifically so much as I am against marriage for love as a whole.

I see marriage as a contract made between two individuals capable of conceiving a child - made not out of love, but out of practical social and economic considerations - to unite behind a common purpose, to produce children and to raise them to the best of their abilities.

To that end, I disagree with the more romantic views of marriage and the idea that marriage must be based on romantic love.  Romantic love is fleeting and not capable of sustaining a marriage beyond 10 years; a higher common purpose is required to make a marriage last, and to homosexual couples, this higher purpose is simply not there.

I consider my views to be incompatible with a broad section of society, far broader perhaps than merely homosexuals.  I am aware that this is a repulsive interpretation of marriage to the modern man (and indeed, the modern woman), and I have no wish to impose this view upon others.  But this repulsive view of mine, and this repulsive understanding of marriage, is inherently incapable of accepting gay marriage as marriage, just as it is incapable of accepting the marriage of infertile or even childfree couples as a married couple.

In other words, I believe that marriage should be about child-rearing and procreation, not love.  I do not doubt that homosexual men and women are just as capable of love as heterosexual men and women, but I am not convinced by the Romantic view that love alone is sufficient for a successful marriage; indeed, at times I wonder if it is even necessary for marriages to be based on love.

The reason that we disagree on the issue of gay marriage, as I see it, is down to a difference in the way we see marriage.  For me and those who are like me (I have found none so far, in case that phrase worries you), marriage is categorically unavailable to homosexual men and women due to their failure to fulfill the purpose of marriage - procreation and the care of their own progeny.  For the vast majority of the world, to whom marriage is merely a means of expressing love - sometimes even transient love (which is something else I truly detest, but which I would not get into as it is not relevant to the topic at hand - gay marriage is a natural right to anyone who is capable of loving someone and being loved in return.

I would like to think that the reason for which many people are against gay marriage is similar to mine; they implicitly understand that the acceptance of gay marriage signals a surrender to the somewhat hedonistic view that marriage is merely for the pleasure of the individual, rather than for the higher purpose - indeed, arguably the highest purpose - of life.  But given the general sorts of comments and posts on this sub, I doubt that my views are popular even around here.  I sometimes wonder if I am alone in my rather unpopular views about marriage.  Perhaps some 500 years back, when infertility was still the only grounds for divorce, I might have found more who would agree with my views.  But this seems to me to only highlight how deeply unfashionable my views have become in the 500 years since.","I actually agree with some of your points about how some marriages don't require love but gay couples have multiple ways to rear children these days

gwv928k,israelexposed,"This is exciting! I wanted to get my hands on undeniable proof of the Israeli propaganda app fucking with Reddit, and here it is!

For those who don't know, Israel has a propaganda app that guides an army into different parts of the internet so they can flood them with reports, vote/like manipulate, and post ready to use propaganda material to misinform the public and censor criticism.

Here are interesting comments by a user about it:

&gt;I also downloaded the app Act-Il to see what it was about. It's a straight up propaganda app. Anyone can sign up and download the app, and you're given 'missions' to go and comment on articles, send complaints about things critical of Israel, report comments by pro-palestinians, etc. Edit: While i'm here, everyone go and report their app in the play store. They would never in a million years allow something like this if it was russian or chinese.  
&gt;  
&gt;The app scares me. I've been meaning to do a post about it for several years now but instead of posting screenshots like I planned I've just mentioned the app a few times over the years. When I first joined the app I could see them targeting posts by palestinian accounts on twitter, reddit threads, facebook posts, NYTimes articles, Washington post, etc. Now I just logged in again and the missions are more savvy. Still a lot of social media, but there's a mission about de-listing BDS as a charity, and it claims that 20,000 people have started the mission. Imagine that - if 20,000 people emailed ActBlue charities to get them to de-list BDS. The fucking platform has probably never received 20,000 emails about anything in all its existence. 

&gt;There's also a mission about emailing UC Irvine about their Israel resolution to claim that the university is no longer safe for jews. (Textbook dogwhistle politics there). There's a mission to report a facebook account called جيش الدفاع الفلسطيني (""the Palestine defence army"") for 'glorifying terrorism'. There's a mission to email a Dutch ministry about the ban on labelling wine as being from 'Judea and Samaria' instead of the 'West Bank'. The mission states that Judea and Samaria have many names ""depending on who you ask"" so it should be ok not to call it occupied West Bank.This is how you do active propaganda on a mass level. And reddit is a category for missions in the app, in case anyone ever wondered how threads get suddenly brigaded by zionists.

fpvj6zw,BlackPillScience,It's a shame that this probably can't be turned around to investigate how strongly those kinds of comments affect a man's chances of attracting someone while controlling for attractiveness. I'm sure the effect of this should be very small.,"It's fairly significant.

My testimony is only anecdotal, but when I learned about the RedPill and was utterly obliterated mentally by it, I *insisted* upon testing the theories out for myself.

In the RP, the term for ""mate copying"" is *preselection*. It was something I was very interested in, mostly because a great deal of human behavior related to decision-making is based upon preselection. Even the illusion of preselection is enough to influence a choice, which is why *advertising* works.

Story time.

I was a regular at a bar some time ago, and the bartender was this amazingly sexy 25 year old (8.5/10 at least.) The clientele was typically 90% male, and no doubt she fended off several advances on the routine. I had a first-date that night, but I arrived early to chat with the other regulars (that's Social Proof,) and wait until my date arrived. I shot some shit with the bartender, didn't get any indicators of interest from her (as usual) before getting a lame ""side-hug"" and going off to read and enjoy my pint.

My date showed up, bought a beer and I waved her over. We bantered for a bit, made out a little, and I decided she was too inebriated and didn't want to have sex with her that night, so I suggested we call it a night while I queued up another date with a younger and more attractive woman.

We left, I picked my second date up and then went back to the same bar. Every regular there was surprised, but remained silent, and it turned out that my second date not only *knew* the bartender, but had attended college with her as well. She mentioned how great I was and excused herself to the restroom. Once out of sight, the bartender saw me with all new eyes and started genuinely interacting with me. Later, she started initiating physical contact with me in front of my date and even sat in my lap. I got her number and we had a fun fling for a couple of weeks.

Once that evidence opened my eyes, I started creating the *appearance* of preselection, by doing things like having an open condom wrapper in my car's cup holder, buying a set of women's lingerie and leaving the panties hanging off of my dresser and the top crumpled in a corner. I also advertised my preselected status by actively referring to other women I was seeing as ""one of my girlfriends."" It made dating infinitely easier.

It doesn't even have to be real. It just needs to be *plausible.*",0

efgw1yr,HateCrimeHoaxes,"Pretty well done but I disagree with some of your conclusions:

Adrenaline/stress/shock in my opinion would lead a victim to immediately remove the noose out of self preservation. Having something wrapped around your neck is a very primal threatening thing. The idea to leave it on in order to preserve evidence is something a calm, rational person would do.

The idea of not going to a bar or club because it would be right before closing and ""not worth the time"" goes completely out the window if your motive is to try to have sex with someone...

People regularly ask police to turn off their body cams when making a report or giving a statement? Is that true? It seems incongruous, surely they understand their report is to be recorded?

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly I agree that even if this is proven to be a hoax no mainstream entity in the world will point out the fact that this man attempted to foment a civil war because he was that angry at white people and Donald Trump. Which horrifyingly mandates that the window is wide open for someone else to try to construct a more elaborate hoax.

If it's a hoax: we desperately need new hate crime laws.

Having something wrapped around your neck is a very primal threatening thing. The idea to leave it on in order to preserve evidence is something a calm, rational person would do.

You raise a very good point. So does that mean he was extremely calm throughout the whole ordeal and if he was, what other reported behaviors support that? Or does it mean he put the rope on himself with the intention of leaving it on for emphasis? 

&gt;The idea of not going to a bar or club because it would be right before closing and ""not worth the time"" goes completely out the window if your motive is to try to have sex with someone...

My main frame of thought behind the sex scenario had to do with hookup apps such as Grindr or Tindr. My apologies, I did fail to mention the use of hookup apps in my original post. Its unlikely, but not impossible, that he went to a club before closing with the intention of hooking up but its plausible he hopped onto a hookup app to arrange a quick encounter.

Im hoping somebody can give me some advice as i am really feeling down and out lately.     

My gf and i broke up after going out for 6 months, we love each other lots but fight too much so we decided to break it off (we had previously broken up and gotten back together many times).     

Now i am trying nonstop to get her out of my head, its been two weeks and this time through the breakup i know its done for good and im doing a lot better than everytime we broke up previously but i still miss her and its weird for me to imagine her and me not being together and going our separate paths.      

i've watched this video probably close to 50 times now and everytime i watch it it helps me out and i realize life goes on but its still tough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIZf0mk5Ju8

duc4y5o,marriedredpill,"Great FR.  I love it.

Your reply to my post in OYS included this 

&gt; I've already started and it is so natural and reminds me how I was way way back when I was single. Thanks.

I had that same a-ha at one point.  It was like ""I used to be like this....if THIS is what I'm supposed to do, this RP thing gonna be way easier than I'm making it""

I used to get so frustrated, because I'd tease my wife and 85% of the time she'd love it and play off it.  Then that other 15% she'd get all hurt, or flip out and be angry.  And I'd argue ""I say stuff like this all the time and you laugh!  What's your problem today?"" leads to Fight leads to Silent Treatment leads to Supplicating.

You get tired of losing that interaction, so deductive reasoning leads to cutting out that part of your personality.   Over the course of years, you end up cutting out everything that gives the feelz.

So the key, IMO, is being able to handle that 15% of the time where your wife can't take a joke.  When you short circuit the petty fight by not engaging, and the silent treatment can't phase you, there's nothing to fear.  

You enjoy the 85% of the time where she's fun, and the 15% of the time where she's not, she sees that her tantrum can't phase you.  Becomes a positive feedback loop.  You win either way.

","Yes, this. I was thinking on the way in this morning about how I couldn't have accepted your advice at first because I was still too afraid of her anger. There's a kind of progression, maybe it's winding things in reverse. First step, you have to develop OI so you stop avoiding making her upset just to get laid. *After that* you have to learn to NGAF and STFU when she's mad so that her being mad doesn't make you fearful and anxious. But you can't stop there, because it's still dysfunctional. What you are talking about is the *next step,* where you learn to ... hmm... take some risks, or accept that you can control a lot of her emotional responses and now you have tools to deal with the times it doesn't work or backfires.  

I don't know if any of that makes sense, it's just what's rolling around in my head this morning. But I feel like I'm understanding how it all works together so much better now.",0

defadkm,RedPillWives,"I think it's helpful to think of cleaning as separate from organizing. Think about wiping down the counters in the kitchen: spray some disinfectant, wipe of with cloth or paper towel. Two minutes, right? So what takes so long? Moving things around, tidying up so you can even begin with the actual task. If basic cleaning tasks are eating up a lot of time, take a look at organization and tidying first.

I'm fond of Marie Kondo's method - you'll find her books at the library if you haven't read them. In a nutshell, she recommends sorting through things by category. I found it helped prevent shifting junk from one room to another. If you find the ""spark joy"" bit confusing while sorting, maybe try this William Morris quote: ""have nothing in your home you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful."" The end goal of the organizing and tidying process is a place for everything and everything in it's place. It's a clean starting point, so you'll know where to find things and where to put them back when you're done.

Next is keeping things tidy, which will save time and facilitate easy cleaning. I particularly liked a recommendation I read somewhere to only touch things once. For example, if you get back from the store and put your coat and purse on the table along with the mail, when it's dinnertime, you'll shift that stuff to the couch so you can eat, then when you want to watch a show, you'll move it again. Just touching it once means you hang up the coat when you get home - done, no need to touch it again until you leave the house, and it'll be right where you can find it. Apply it to everything: just put things back in their place when you're done. Now when it's time to clean, there's no prolonged tidy session, just wipe things down, sweep, vaccuum, etc.

It sounds like you'll have a very generous budget, which is really nice. Why not try it now? You can probably easily live on your husband's salary and save yours for a baby nest egg, or start a travel savings account for the future (how great for your kids to be able to see new places!), add to retirement. It'll give you a chance to ease into budgeting without it being do or die.","Both cleaning and organizing are tough -- I'll just say it right now, I have ADHD and so does my husband, so detail-oriented tasks take a lot of effort and are easily overwhelming. I've read some of Marie Kondo's stuff, and I really like the idea of it...but it's tough. We're not good at fighting clutter, and we're both very impulsive. We're definitely working on this, but for now a housekeeper is pretty much a necessity. We do have lots of ""places"" for things and we try really hard to adhere to that as best we can, but it's really a constant struggle. I think we do a pretty good job, considering, but it's unfortunately not the kind of thing that will ever become second-nature.

That's partly why the budget, as generous as it is, is a concern -- we're both impulse buyers, so it's actually going to be a really big change. I think that you and the other commenter are right, though -- it makes sense to do this in steps.

The reason Whales such as these attack is because they are often under copious amounts of stress (Such as the dorsal fin drooping to the side, It's due to stress) This occurs usually because when the Whales are taken from their Pods (Groups, Families) they are babies, or very young and as Whales are very, very social animals they do not handle very well without their mother by their side. Fortunately a good portion of the actual trainers are oblivious to what goes on behind the scene, they genuinely love the Whales. People seem to think that Whales and Humans have a special bond when they see Orca Whales doing tricks, but in reality, they are starved of food if they fail to preform a trick, so the Whale learns that if he/she does the trick, he/she is fed a treat.

ed0nbi7,BlackPillScience,"Respect and muscles? Does having muscles, cause to recieve more respect from men and women? And some halo effect?

(do you have some data to share that confirms/denies it?)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for asking.   
Is that I notice to recieve less respect from others, both men and women, compared to several years ago when I was together with my girlfriend (that was average+ looking). That relationship ended 3 years ago. And I since then decided to go celibate (for Buddhist religion practise reason).

Initally I didn't notice much difference. Over years though, I have noticed people around me have started to show less and less respect. And also overall i feel to experience less respected, and more being shitted on.   
Now, not much has changed in my looks since before. I was and still am a slim (BMI 20) average looking 30-something year old. So I started to wonder and think, that it might be caused by this difference from before: not having a decent looking girlfriend for a while.

Now I want to try to get given more respect again and less shit. Because it just makes things difficult (to get what i want or wish) and it pisses me off to be shitted on. And since violence is not an accepted and acceptable option to gain respect.  
I was wondering if becoming muscled, may help to recieve more respect again. Either because of fear, or because of ""admiration""?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone has some data, or personal experience for me?

f0xmkkn,HBD,"Don’t drink alcohol or do drugs, or at the very least don’t make a habit out of it, or even worse a lifestyle.  Junkies, i.e. people who are subject to their addiction  aren’t respected and rightly so.  Stoners invariably are unmotivated, uninteresting and undisciplined losers.  If you need any substance to feel better or to get by then you’re weak and actively avoiding the growth that comes from struggle.  Weak people avoid pain, strong people welcome it.

Do gym everyday.  If you’re fat, lose weight.  If you’re skinny, get muscle.  Heavy compound lifts are where its at.  Starting Strength program is typically recommended for beginners.  Get your diet in check too - no processed garbage that the Western diet revolves around, no soft drinks, no chips, no doughnuts, no feel-good sugar coated trash food.  Bulk of your calories should come from fats and proteins.  Learn a martial arts - I perfer boxing, but Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai, Krav Maga are all appropriate.  Learn to defend yourself, don't let another man dominate you.

If you’re at school, university etc, then treat it as a job which requires you to put in the hours, and treat it as a competition which you can’t afford to lose - you should be the top student in your class because anything less is a bitch move. Most of the students in class won’t have this attitude - because they’re lazy, unmotivated and more concerned about their social lives than knowledge and career prospects.  And if you’re going to university don’t study a course which has little employment chances or which is dominated by leftist ideology (typically they go hand-in-hand).

And if you’re not in formal study, you should still be studying because knowledge is a value within itself.  Read everyday and read widely - science texts, history (especially military history), philosophy texts, memoirs, classics, religious texts, personal growth books etc.  Fiction has a place, but a small one.

Wake up early, even on your days off - and there shouldn’t be days off.  By the time most people have woken up I’ve already read for an hour, had breakfast, done gym, showered and set out what I need to do for the day.  Have a plan, have long term goals, have short term goals, all these should be aligned so that your daily habits are congruent with your objectives.  Get your sleep in check - no staying up late watching garbage on Youtube.

Social media is largely a waste of time - this includes Reddit.  If you post everyday on Reddit you’re wasting your time.  Look at the [photos](http://i.imgur.com/VBW3viW.jpg) of any Reddit meetup - and ask yourself if they are the people whose advice/comments you would listen to.  Remember this anytime you read the comments section of any mainstream sub.  Same goes for Instagram, Facebook or whatever.  If you’re playing video games for 8 hours a day then you’re wasting your time.  Not saying to give up video games up entirely, but if you're playing them and avoiding the tasks you need to do then that is a problem.  For younger men, don't fall in love with the first girl, don't be a white knight, wear a condom, don't be gullible etc.  Don't make a hoe a housewife.  Don't watch porn, its degenerate and will fuck with healthy sexual desires and motivations.

(Numbers 32 1 - 18)

ITS IN THE BIBLE.

If they are Christian the above is what they believe. That includes the entire Republican party including the president.","So this is the problem with the simplistic view that the Bible is just an instruction manual for Christianity. It's a collection of disparate books that make up a salvation narrative. Part of that narrative includes a time when the people needed simple rules to live by because they lacked the moral foundation to live up more fully to God's designs. Thus Jesus is challenged by the Jewish scholars on the topic of divorce, which is permitted in certain circumstances in the Old Testament. He replies to them that it was allowed only because of their hardness of hearts, and calls his followers to understand that no couple joined by God can rightfully be separated by man.

Looking at the Bible in such a simplistic way leads only to confusion and error, particularly of the type above where people imagine that Christians are bound to observe Mosiac restrictions, despite the argument and resolution of that very issue being recorded in the book of Acts.

 * 20
 * Male
 * Straight
 * College
 * Skinny
 * Been told as too cute for relationships.

Previous situations - in chronological order (earliest-latest): 

 * Chronic Oneitis. 
 * I've had people flat out lie to me that someone had an interest with me. I believed them like the gullible fool I was. Can't really trust anyone anymore.
 * Went to lunch with a HB7 once. Now avoids me like the plague, while still claiming I'm ""nice.""
 * Until VERY recently, I was incredibly interested in having a LTR, mainly because of everyone else in one. Green with envy would be right on the money.

Current situation

 * Final year at college. Potentially off to uni next year.
 * Friends jokingly want me to get laid. Or as they say, ""Get my game on.""
 * While out, people was shocked when I said I currently at the stage of not caring about getting laid now.

I'm currently conflicted by these thoughts. On one hand, yeah I guess deep down, I still may be interested in playing the field. On the other hand, after almost 10 years of trying, I'm not particularly wanting to continue with fruitless results, while some guy who can pretty much call a girl a whore for the entire night and end up getting laid with that same girl. And yes, this HAS happened.

So, askseddit, I ask you, what do I do?","I totally get it. At the end of the day, those events are just obstacles on your way to achieving your goals.

e0qsxqi,TheRedPill,"In the wake of #MeToo, Netflix classifies 5 second staring as Sexual Harassment **Summary:** \#MeToo has furthered the feminist imperative and now you can be sued for harassment if you look at a coworker for more than 5 seconds. 

**Body:** For those of you that are unaware, Kevin Spacey was the key actor in one of Netflix's most viewed series' *The House of Cards*. He got caught up in the #MeToo hysteria perpetuated by the left and was accused of sexually harassing a 14 year old boy over **30 years ago.** Now that its 2018 apparently even those in Hollywood are struggling to escape penalty for their sick perversion. Nevermind the fact that this occurred in 1986 and is highly questionable, Netflix, in fear of public backlash, took the *$39 million* hit from removing Spacey from the show. This hit was due to not releasing content that was ALREADY produced. In the modern world, not even the rich and powerful are escaping feminists and their army of SJW's. 

Now this has led to more rules in restrictions in the already complex and exhausting corporate world. #MeToo has caused companies everywhere to ramp up procedures to prevent all the women from the evil male sexual harassment. **The new policy at Netflix now classifies staring at a coworker for more than 5 seconds as possibly being perceived at sexual harassment.** Obviously, this is targeting men, like all other nonsense sexual harassment rules. From now on, when Kathy comes in with her huge tits hanging out, Beta Billy better be careful or he could get sued for looking over at her. She wanted VP Chad to notice, not Billy. Netflix is encouraging employees to ""Shout ‘Stop, don’t do that again!’ if a colleague has been inappropriate."" 

Obviously the pinheads and feminists in HR's all over the world are going to hear about this and think, ""Wow! I need to implement this in our company."" These morons were the kids that collected all the gold stars in kindergarten and just love rules and regulations. That is why women love HR roles. Even though this has become a joke amongst your average day Netflix employees, the feminists and SJW's of the world are going to no doubt use this rule to fuck over men everywhere. It is becoming worse and worse to work in corporate America and men need to prepare for encountering this nonsense in their careers even if they are careful. If you decide to work in corporate, you are going to need to exercise extreme caution when dealing with any girls in your company. This rule will spread to other companies until people finally realize how ridiculous this entire value system is. It is harder than even now to navigate the corporate world if you are a guy and it is only getting worse. 

**Summary:** Netflix now counts staring at someone for 5 seconds greater as sexual harrassment. You are not safe in your job and can get fired if a girl accuses you of looking at her.

Marina Joyce is a YouTube fashion blogger who does video blogs of makeup tutorials and clothing brands.

#What happened to her?

* Well, according to the internet, Marina Joyce may be in serious trouble. Her latest video shows her in a pastel doll-styled dress looking out of her mind. At 0:13 seconds in the video, a subtle murmer can be heard over her monologue. Fans claim she is whispering ""help me."" There are tons of videos and articles talking about it.

* International Business Times wrote [""What Happened To Marina Joyce? YouTuber Apparently Whispers ‘Save Me’ Amid Abuse, Drug Rumors""](http://www.ibtimes.com/what-happened-marina-joyce-youtuber-apparently-whispers-save-me-amid-abuse-drug-2394990)

* She later responded to fans in a Tweet telling them she is perfectly fine. https://twitter.com/MarinaJoyce7/status/757670474109358080

* There is a #SaveMarinaJoyce hashtag on Twitter at the moment as well.

* LolCowFarm has a thread discussing the latest videos and theories [here](https://lolcow.farm/snow/res/159476.html#160441)

#This is where it gets a bit creepy

If you look at the videos of Marina Joyce found on those news sites, it's obvious that she has bruises and isn't acting like a normal human being. But that isn't creepy, it's sad. What *is* creepy is this tweet:

* Then there is this tweet: https://twitter.com/foreignhotlines/status/758155296544059392

 * This is most likely fake but nonetheless it adds to the conspiracy that it's all a big trap.

* Here is the creepy guy that's mentioned on the LolCowFarms thread.

###UPDATE: VIDEO FROM THIS MORNING.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=045LyemxRO0

She claims her bruises were from an ""accident"" but isn't clear what type of accident. It does look like she isn't being held by ISIS so Abu Bakr al-Bagdadi will have to find his own Khaleesi. She seems aloof in the video.

e897zeb,RedPillWives,"Taking care of your appearance at home I'm always a little sad whenever I see pictures of couples sitting on their couch in sweatpants, old shirts and messy hair. I believe a woman who wants to be high value can't just neglect her appearance just because she's at home with her man and 'nobody sees me anyway'. 

Your man sees you! If you dress up and look beautiful for anyone it's him! Not the strangers you encounter outside of your home!

Of course he will appreciate it and think of you as a high value woman when you take the time to take care of your appearance, do your hair, put on a little make up and make sure you are dressed nicely, don't have a bad breath and wear his favorite fragrance.

Another part of this is wearing 'household clothes' to protect your appearance. When I'm at my fiance's place and I'm cooking or doing chores I wear a cute apron that not just protects my clothes and appearance but I also know he enjoys seeing me in them. He didn't like it when I put my hair in a bun so now I wear kerchiefs to protect my hair and look extra cute. I wear gloves to make sure my hands stay soft and don't get rough from the cleaning agent. Those are simple ways to look cute and take care of your appearance at the same time.

There is so much value in keeping up your appearance around him, no matter where you are. What's your opinion on this? And do you also wear aprons or specific clothes for household tasks?","Hmm, I think I dress to the level my husband dresses for the most part.

d4q13xz,TheRedPill,"ARE YOU SERIOUSLY HAVING A PROBLEM WITH GOT? Like, I can understand you hating on the shitty Sand Snakes, and some of the plot deviations, but the last few episodes have been absolutely amazingly good.

IT'S FUCKING AWESOME.

Like why the fuck do you have a problem with women having power in it? all the women in power were fucking raped. Now they get their fucking revenge.

Margaerys dying was a calamity.

Jon Targaryen isn't a cuck. Seizing power all the time isn't ""manly"". Lots of people don't want power. Manliness is having the power and willingly giving it up (Jesus Christ)

Why the fuck would Jon want power? he just wants to see his family line and humanity survive the winter.

Tywin was a cunt who totally deserved it. Robert was a drunk shithead who couldn't keep his queen content: all he had to do was be considerate to her and he would still be alive (he stopped lifting and all that boring stuff trp wants lol).

Stannis murdered his own daughter.

It's fun having all the powerful people be women. Lyanna Mormont is fucking awesome and her actor has never acted before (FUCKING TWELVE YEARS OLD AND ALREADY FUCKING BADASS).

Most of the women will probably die in the Long Night. Most of the men have already died.

It's not an SJW film really. They blew up the faggot lol. They have all the women raped for no reason...

","1. Female drama has completely taken over reason in the show. The last 2 episodes are a shit dump without any sense of logic. If you don't not see the stupidity and just get off from the cheap soap-opera melodrama, where the good guys win and the bad guys get what they deserve, you might be a twat. Double check to be sure. Well developed plots, strategies, politics and power struggles, are all replaced with fast revenge solutions, straightforward thinking and deus-ex machina. Exactly the opposite of what the show was about and what made it great.

2. There are no real men on the show. All have been killed off, and the ones left standing are either weak, castrated, lacking limbs, killed and returned from the dead, a dwarf, a crippled etc. All are cucked somehow. Jon is Sansa's bitch (fights her battle, almost left to die on the battlefield, makes nothing of her betrayal), the dwarf is Dany's bitch, Jaime is Cercei's bitch, Theon is Yara's bitch, Tommen is Margaery's bitch (or was) etc. All men had to be fucked somehow and lowered under females, to make women look more powerful, because there is no other way for a women to look powerful next to a powerful man.

3. You have an all powerful Queen with no real skill, intelligence, understanding of politics and reality. She tames dragons, rules over a huge army of rapists and savages, and an army of eunuchs. She single-handedly killed all alpha leaders of the most powerful warriors in one blow, and took over their army. She has by her side a dwarf, a castrated politician, a castrated warrior, an alpha Chad warrior that turned into a little bitch almost crying at her knees (ultimate female fantasy) and another alpha warrior that risks his life to hell and back for her. She supposedly fights for peace and freedom for everybody in the world. Promises lesbian Yara a throne just because she's a woman. Makes her promise not to rape and pillage anymore, but disregards that most of her army is made from rapers and pillagers (but of course, she'll tame them eventually). 

4. You have a scrawny little girl princess that popped out of nowhere and is smarter than all the men ruling the great houses of the north. Puts them all in their place with a few words and makes them apologize for being stupid.

5. You have another scrawny little girl with a death list on a killing rampage in the name of justice and revenge. She can not be stopped and it is clear she will survive everyone in the show just because.

6. You have a swordsman female that bested one of the best fighters in the realm, the Hound. 

7. You have a cunt princess that was forced into marriage, raped and abused, but got oh so strong and overcame her rape. She got complete revenge over her abuser. Girl Powa'!

8. You have the old woman (Tyrell) that is smarter than all around her and controls her House. Now she goes after revenge. 

9. You have a fallen queen that makes all irrational mistakes possible for 6 seasons but ends up on the Iron Throne after she got her revenge.

10. You have a bunch of lesbian tomboys taking over a kingdom because they wanted revenge and the king didn't.

11. Whatever the writers did differently from the books, it reeks of PC feminism BS, cheap drama and complete lack of logic. Fuck it. No more.",1

f4205ps,TheRedPill,Survey with 1000 people about Masculinity. ,"Interesting stats.

&gt;50% of men are uncomfortable seeing two men kiss

Notice how right away there are trying to equate masculinity with homophobia when in reality they have nothing to do with each other.

&gt; 19% of men identify as feminists.

That's actually lower than I thought, I hope that number doesn't go up but with all the indoctrination going around I am worried it will.  I wish they would ask men how many consider themselves Red Pilled but they probably don't want men to even hear the phrase lest it lead them here or to MGTOW.

&gt; 37% of men say they are uncomfortable crying at weddings

Why are they asking about weddings?  I have never cried at a wedding not because I would have felt uncomfortable but because it isn't the sort of thing to make me cry.  Such a stupid question and obviously meant to mislead the reader.  If they were serious they should have just replaced the word ""weddings"" with ""funerals"".

&gt; Percentage of men who worry about their mental health on a daily basis:

&gt; Ages 16 to 34: 38%
Ages 35 to 64: 20%

The age difference can easily be explained by our gynocentric society telling boys that there is something wrong with them for acting like boys and treating them like they are defective girls, among other things.

&gt; 10% of men have taken a yoga class

This also has nothing to do with masculinity.  Yoga is good for your health and all the best yoga instructors are men who are in phenomenal shape.

&gt; 38% of men have used a moisturizer in the past six months.

I'd really like to see a racial breakdown of this one because I'm guessing that 38% includes a lot of black dudes.

&gt; 72% have raised their voice to settle an argument.

Oh FFS, who doesn't raise their voice in a heated argument?  This is presented as if it's evidence of ""toxic masculinity"" and implies that women don't also do this.

&gt; 54% have seen their fathers cry.

I have seen my dad cry exactly once, when our beloved family dog died.

&gt; 45% of men say they want to be somewhat or very similar to their fathers

I'm guessing the other 56% are mostly either the children of single mothers or divorced women who get custody and both are raised to be what Rollo calls ""promise keepers"".

I would like to embellish your remarks about Christianity a bit. 

There was a question about whether circumcision should be required for Christians early in the First Century.

It was resolved in the negative at the Council at Jerusalem in 49 A. D. which is reported in Acts of the Apostles 15:1-30.

[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+15%3A1-30&amp;version=NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+15%3A1-30&amp;version=NIV)

There is this exception: The Coptic Church which is found mainly in Egypt, is reported to practice circumcision.","I dont know if I want to/should open this can of worms, but I dont understand how anyone can argue that circumcision is not encouraged in the bible. 

The fact that early christians decided that circumcision was (is) stupid and unnecessary does not mean that god didnt demand it at one point. He did demand it. Early Jewish morality was fucked up and that is reflected in their barbaric religion. From slaughtering entire villages (by warriors who god magically enchanted), to demanding public executions via stoning (including as a punishment for having been raped), to demanding circumcision, and on and on, honestly.

ew5wxlc,kotakuinaction2,"Monica Rial Deposition (Vic Mignona related) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M23dZ2vI0Q

Reiketa is doing streams on Monica Rials deposition now. Is anyone keeping up with this that can give me a TL:DW of the funniest highlights? 

Yeah yeah personal army and all...","You all should be ashamed of yourselves. Monica is doing her best to recount events as she remembers them, obviously recounting very traumatic events of her life, and you all are making fun of her, calling her a liar, and completely minimizing what she's been through because she's not going about things the way you want her to? Did none of you ever think that maybe she felt intimidated by his power over her to comply with what he wanted her to do, because fighting back would be detrimental to her career? Does no one even consider the fact that it's extremely common during a sexual assault for the victim to dissociate, or mentally check out due to BEING FUCKING ASSAULTED AND TERRIFIED FOR THEIR LIVES??? And that maybe doing so makes it hard to remember shit like what day it is?? 

This is why victims sometimes don't come forward when the assault first happens. The mockery, the accusations of lying, the victim-blaming, the criticism in how she's not handling things the ""right"" way. Monica did not do anything except come forward about a traumatic experience in her life, and she didn't want to see her assaulter be praised to high heavens when he violated her in the worst possible way. 

She did not demand that he be fired and blacklisted from the industry, she did not send hordes of trolls to his social media accounts; she simply same forward about something that was probably eating her inside for years, knowing DAMN WELL that she wouldn't be believed, that she would be mocked and criticized to no end. She is incredibly brave for doing this, and anyone who doesn't believe her or thinks she's a lying vindictive bitch can kindly fuck right off.",2
fi7eo7l,LGBDropTheT,"Excuse this rather lame and limited manual, but I think all you need to know is the following:

Post Modernism started as a method for critiquing literature (as I understand it) the proponents were skeptical about the notion of Objective (what it is) and Subject (how we perceive it) reality (for instance a ""shoe"" isn't a universal reality in that it will mean different things to a Roman gladiator in the 1st century compared a lumberjack in the 19th century). This lead to the idea of the socially conditioned nature of knowledge (society influences how we see the truth) which *denies* the existence of a universal, stable reality (nothing is ""real"", we're just making things up to suit our needs).

&amp;#x200B;

In 3rd wave Feminism (academic Gender Studies), this was used to justify the theory that ""gender is a construct"". So, all a cis man with a penis has to do is nothing more than state he is *trans* in order to ""construct"" the reality that he is somehow *not* a man with a penis, or some fucking non nonsense.","This infuriates me. It is a problem understanding that concepts are different then matter. The word ""shoe"" isn't a shoe it is either a grouping of signs or a grouping of phonemes. The word represents a social constructed concept. This is how all objects work. To a non human there is an objective truth and that is that there is an object and it has mass. People get so stuck in words they don't realize they are arguing bullshit. 

This may be a tangent but it always bothers me.",0

db8lcoe,Gender_Critical,When I was 9 my mother wouldn't even let me wear nail polish. These parents let him die his hair pink?,"Unfortunately Katie Couric's Gender Revolution National Geographic documentary reinforces  very common gender myths and gender stereotypes,that has never been proven,that gender identity is caused by in utero hormones,that ''hard wire our brains to be female or male.


 It has an interview with parents of two little boys and the younger one ''became'' a girl,and the mother says that her youngest son told her that she knew she was a girl in her heart and brain,and of course loves to wear lots of dresses.



I have read posts on forums similar to this,by heterosexual women,many who are married who said they hated dresses as children and some still do as adults,and they said they were ''tom boys'' as little girls.


Not to mention before world war two people used to dress little boys in pink because it was seen as a strong ''masculine'' light red color,and put girls in blue because it was seen as delicate and ''feminine''.

Important information from October 2015 by neuroscientist Dr.Lise Elliott about how new large research shows the sexes brains are much more alike than different! Three major areas in the brain that were claimed to be different were found to not be different using over 6,000 women and men including the myth that the corpus callosum is more connected in women.

 
 http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-10/rfuo-mbd102915.php





Here is a new January 2017 extensive brain study by neuroscientist Dr.Lise Elliot and her colleagues did of 30 years worth of brain scans of women and men and girls and boys in the area of the brain called the amygdala which past studies based on much smaller samples claimed to have significant differences between the sexes. The findings show that despite the impression  that men and women are profoundly different large analyses of brain measures are finding far more similarity than difference,there is no categorically ''male'' brain or ''female'' brain and much more overlap than difference for nearly all brain measures.The article says this area of the brain is a key structure involving all types of  emotion and social behaviors such as aggression and sexual arousal.



 Dr.Lise Eliot said,It mentions implications for understanding transgenderism in this new article too.

It measures how well single individuals do on written exams concerning word problems. Also, there is no standard between different tests or testing agencies to ensure any reliability between tests. It's bunk. Geniuses of every color have scored well below 100 on IQ tests. Intelligence itself is not something you can quantify with a written paper test. For example: Louis Armstrong was a musical genius who failed out of school at a young age. But you could never be as talented as him at creative improvisation with singing or the trumpet. Kim Peek was a white man who could read two book pages at once and had a near-perfect memory but couldn't understand personal hygiene. How would your pathetic IQ tests gauge their intelligence? See, your pathetic intellect has to over-simplify an infinitely complex concept like intelligence into purely a race issue.
Race is also not a scientific metric as it over-simplifes the concept of ethnicity to their skin color. Black people are the most genetically diverse people on the planet. The range of intelligence between individuals within ethnic groups is FAR GREATER than between ethnic groups. Are you keeping up? Making generalizations about us just shows your ignorance about biology.

c34kbo3,ForeverAlone,"Why don't geek guys like geek girls? I'm getting really pissed off about dating. 
Essentially it boils down to this: I'm a female, 31 years old. I'm a cool chick, first into punk then goth, then into the psychedelic scene... all the while being quite intelligent (not trying to boast but it's the truth; my ex-husband is one of the higher ups in Google and he had a hard time dealing with me challenging him intellectually). 

Basically I've noticed this pattern my whole life. I'm a smart boyish girl, while still loving makeup and glitter and all that girlish stuff. And thus I've always had male friends... generally of the geeky or punk/goth/outsider variety. I would always hear these guys bitching about stupid girls but at the same time *never* wanting to date me. Because I'm ""one of them"".

No matter what group I hang out in.... geeks/weirdos/romantics.... the guys always want the same girl... the stupid blonde cheerleader type. Then they bitch about how the girl doesn't ""get them"", but they won't actually date girls who would. Because, IMO, most guys may preach that they want an equal but can't handle it when they do.

Of couse this isn't 100% universal. There are guys who want the smart, weird, geeky girl and get her. But many act like they do only to actually want the dumb model, or get angry when they meet a girl that can actually challenge them intellectually since they are so used to telling the girl what to do or treating them like something out of a magazine.

So yeah... I'm currently drunk off vodka and finally feel like ranting. I'm a girl who has spent 20 years dealing with rejection because I'm smart. And I'm sick of guys always wanting the same stupid ditzy girl all while claiming they don't. 

Smart guys think they are poor off, but believe me it's worse the other way around because smart guys don't want smart girls, they want the hot dumb idiots, while smart girls want smart guys. 

But hey, prove me wrong!
I would love nothing more than to finally be seduced by someone wooing me with their intelligence and getting turned on by me exploring back :)

f80d9y9,RedPillWomen,"Having trouble surrendering Hi all, I just need some help with an issue I'm struggling with...

Recently my husband and myself have decided for me to become a homemaker. I've been wanting to do this my entire life, but I've finally accepted it after years of being guilty for wanting this. I was raised in a very feminist household and my parents would be ashamed if they knew.

I'm having trouble, however, overcoming my guilt. He is VERY happy with me being a homemaker and I am so happy too, but I feel so guilty leaving the financial responsibilities on him. I cook and clean and perform all the household tasks, and we're trying to have a baby right now.

I'm constantly anxious that my husband will randomly lose his job and then blame me for not working (he has NEVER done this, it's an irrational fear). I talk to him about my fears almost daily and it's starting to annoy him... I'm so happy to be a homemaker, but I can't shake my guilt/worry. 

How do I cope with these feelings? Any advice? My husband is wonderful but is growing tired of me worrying all the time and wishes I would just enjoy being at home as I've wanted to do this for so long.","I have recently decided to become a homemaker too and it was incredibly tough decision for me. 

I have felt very strong desire and purpose to become a housewife but I struggled with the fact that it is such a rare “occupation” especially for young girls (I’m 21). 

My whole life I have deemed myself to be very intelligent and ambitious person who wanted to prove everyone how high I can get. I associated ambition, wits, interesting personality and passions only with a career. After I started working in a corporation and understood how all of this works and how does a typical schedule look like I decided that it is not what seems right for me and it is not something my heart longs for.  Everyday I daydreamed about staying at home and cooking, cleaning, having time to finally take care of my looks and my interests. I wanted to have energy to greet my husband after he comes home and be available for him. 

It was hard to get rid of the stereotype that women who stay at home are lazy and unproductive. That they have no personality. It hurt my ego a lot and I didn’t want to admit I could be one of these people. But now I know I am not and I won’t be and that those are just stereotypes that I shouldn’t care about. 

My only worry was that something might happen to my husband. But then I thought... what is the actual probability of that happening? Surely - tragic events take place in the world but how often do men in developed, safe countries suddenly die at age of 35? We shouldn’t organize our lives around unlikely events! Everyday when we leave home we face risk of dying in some horrible accident or a crime. Every time we enter a car or a plane we take a risk of dying in a car crash. If everyone were to worry what will happen to them or their relatives no one would ever leave the house! Not to mention you can easily die at home as well. But we all know these things are not so common. 

And even if my husband were to die very soon... I am happy I will stay at home to spend more time with him and cherish him and serve him, instead of wasting my time in front of monitor, counting when can I return home. 

You need to put faith in your man. It makes them do incredible things. You worrying about him loosing job is sending him a clear message that you don’t believe in him and his competence and it really hurts men ego. Try thanking him and saying how grateful you are to be able to stay home. Tell him how lucky you feel to have a man that is so hardworking and provides for you - like a REAL man. I will guarantee you... he will work even harder and be more motivated for you and your future kids!",0

1. Don’t trust automobile drivers to see you or stop.

1. Look carefully for high power lines when working with downed poles or ladders.  

1. Being burned alive is probably the worst way to die.  Being dismembered alive by drug gang members is probably second worst.  

1. Vigilante justice often gets things wrong. 

1. People are still getting stoned to death. 

1. Never put your head or body into industrial machinery, unless you’ve confirmed that the power has been cut off.  

1. Don’t piss off Brazilian gangs or Mexican drug cartels.

People will find in time that they sympathize more and more with the ideology as it gains prevalence and is less receptive to outside manipulation.

There are also, like, 10 tankies (Stalin apologists) over on CTH. They post a lot, so it seems like there are more of them.

Also, even the demsocs (who are usually pro democracy and free speech) tend to agree that it's OK to punch fascists, per the paradox of tolerance. As long as it's an actual fascist getting punched and not just a generic conservative who suffers just as much under capitalism as all others do.

Also, they tend to say 'post hog' because far right people are usually homophobes, and therefore leave the place when asked to post their genitalia. Thus, CTH doesn't get overrun by far-righters, even though CTH never bans dissenters (unlike most other political subreddits, like socialism, conservative and t_d.)

eggr9vc,smuggies,"&gt; The bitch could be naked in the club and you still dont touch her, why is that a hard concept to understand? Doesnt matter how ""slutty"" or ""loose"" she seems, no girl( or man for that matter ) is ever asking to be sexually assaulted. Full stop

“Man runs onto highway and is struck by car”

Does the man deserve to be hit by the car?

Is it at all surprising that he was?

Would you advise him to run onto the highway because he deserves to have fun and fuck the haters?
","So what you’re saying is that a man (the woman) deserves to be hit by a car (sexually harassed or assaulted) for running onto a highway (going into a “grimy” place or dressing a certain way). 

Let’s take your analogy further. Did the man make an effort to avoid a collision? Did he hit the brakes, swerve, and other things to try and remove himself from the situation? Then the courts will recognize that, and his charge will be reduced to involuntary manslaughter, and that might even be too serious. 

Or did he speed up, serve *into* the man, and go out of his way to hit them because they justified it by saying “Well if he didn’t want to get hit he shouldn’t have come onto the highway.” Then the courts will recognize that as well, and his charge will increase to vehicular homicide. 

That’s what your arguing. Your analogy completely takes away the responsibility of the motorist (assaulter) and places blame solely on what you perceive to be the mistakes (dressing “slutty” or going to a grimy bar) of the man running onto the highway (the woman). You’re also trying to use a situation where physics would play a role in the amount of time the situation could be remedied in comparison to a guy keeping his hands to himself, it’s asinine

The other thing that makes this fall through, and the biggest one in my mind, is that the basis of your argument is that women should be conscious of the men around them at all times, and dress to the occasion or act accordingly. To you, a woman dressed slutty is EXPECTED to be assaulted, the same way a man running into the highway is expected to be hit. That’s not a problem with the woman, that’s a problem with you. ",2

fgpn2k2,WatchRedditDie,Is there any social media where the Feminazis dont dominate,"8chan, but that’s gone now too",1
ek4nu4c,Homophobes,I’ve decided you are straight because all you do think about is how straight people do privately with their genitalia.,"I'm pretty gay. You know, when I see a straight couple, it may shock you, but I don't immediately think about them bashing bits if they're just living their lives out in public. Most of my friends are in straight relationships or are looking for one, and I don't feel the need to speculate about the sexual aspects that may or may not be present. Right now, the only bits I'm really interested about in that way belong to my boyfriend. 

I feel like a lot of straight people don't have that attitude towards gay people, though. And because of that, there's kind of a double standard in terms of what I can do in public with my boyfriend versus what a straight couple would be able to do. For example, even though I'm in a relatively accepting area, I still don't feel safe doing something as simple as holding hands with him walking down the street together. Meanwhile, nobody would bat an eye at a straight couple doing the exact same thing. I think that part of the reason why this may be is because some straight people don't see gay people as people because they see sexuality and romance in terms of an ethics of purity and degradation.

But what does that mean? Well, it's a moral view that portrays good as the abhorrence of the disgusting. It underlies the widespread idea that the body is a temple which can be desecrated by immoral activities and contaminants. By itself, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It can provide a basis for moral thought that people who want to live in a more elevated and less carnal way can follow. 

But, because this way of thinking about morality can often conflict with other ideas about morality, like philosophies that focus more on autonomy/oppression, and fairness/injustice, if gay people are the objects of your disgust, then unreasoning abbhorence will lead to you trampling over the other moral concepts like liberty and justice in order to ""purge the impure"", even if they have all the same right as you to exist and live their lives. All of this, of course, for no other reason other than because you're just disgusted by them deep down. 

And this form of ethics doesn't just hurt gay people. It hurts straight people too. Think about it like this. How many times have you heard the phrase ""Fellas, is it gay if...""? Often, what's being asked isn't even involving sexual intercourse with a person of the same gender. It's stuff like ""Is it gay to like having your nipples sucked by a girl?"" or ""Is it gay to have a girl peg you?"". Since both of those things are heterosexual sexual activities, they are *checks notes* not gay. But the purpose of the question isn't to be reasonable, it is to keep enforcing that same ethics of purity, stopping straight people from doing what they want with their bodies. 

This creates a double standard, where any deviance from an assigned sexual or romantic role is seen as a grievous sin, worthy of punishment and eradication. That's the thought process behind the kind of violence I'm afraid might hurt me, and is already hurting thousands of queer people around the world. So, while I am a gay person, and not disgusted by straight sex at all, homophobes are, and will use that disgust as a moral excuse to restrict my rights and be violent towards me.",2

This tax is even more racist than if we tried to impose a tax on fried chicken (ostensibly because fried chicken causes heart disease, of course *wink wink*), and wouldn't a tax on fried chicken sound racist as shit?

No, I've never used a tanning salon, and I avoid associating with the type of people who do, but I resent this tax more than any other because it obviously targets people based on their color of their skin (and probably gender too).

Am I right, or just crazy?","Well chicken does have sales tax on it for starters.  And studies have proven that long term use of tanning beds pretty much guarantees skin cancer.

Given that under the new system reckless self-cancering is a cost to us all, so you're paying for your future doctors visits with your taxes.",0

ciliusp,TheRedPill,"&gt; How many CEOs are male? How many presidents are male? How many members of congress are male? Don't be fooled by feminists, this is not the result of a social construct. This is a fact that is GLOBAL in scale, deeply rooted in human biology.

I'm not trying to insight a war here. I really would like a reasonable discussion on TRP. If this is not the place to do this, then let me know and I'll try elsewhere. However, if you agree with the logic of the OP's post, then it seems in order to be logically consistent that you must also believe that the same must be true for minorities who traditionally have not occupied leadership roles. I'm not saying this is wrong or right, just that it is exactly the same logic that the OP is using to draw his conclusions. (only 1.2% of CEO's are black, only 8% of congress etc...)  In order to be consistent, you would also have to say that blacks have biological differences that make them not as good leaders as whites.  

Personally I believe that this conclusion is not necessary, even though the OP's premises may be true. His argument in my opinion commits the fallacy of division, i.e. the characteristic of a group is applied to one individual. I would love a dicussion on this point. If this is not the right place let me know and I'll go elsewhere.","&gt; you would also have to say that blacks have biological differences that make them not as good leaders as whites.

Yes but that is in AMERICA where the black population was brought here on slave ships and suffered under the oppression of an existing power structure and is still a MINORITY.

But my retort - Nelson Mandela, Genghis Khan, Ghandi - All not white. Within non-white countries there are leaders who are just as much the equals of white leaders. I hazard to guess that in China 0.0% of CEO's and Leaders are black **OR** white, for obvious reasons--there are no whites or blacks in China (of any numbers). Even in America we have Martin Luther King Jr. and Obama.

To further the point of the initial argument... you will note however that at all times women have been 50% of all populations, or close to it.

Now I make that observation and let it stand for itself without drawing any conclusion--I must say this whole TRP viewpoint is new to me so I won't go for the kill. But it would seem it is up to a feminist to argue against this prima facie observation to conclude that woman have had some non-biological detriment imposed on them throughout all of history.",2

f23n89,DebateAltRight,"Mulatto Nationalism, and The Future of America So, I've been right wing since a bit before the 2016 election and lately I've been ruminating on this thought that I feel is a synthesis of ethnonationalism and ""civic nationalism"" for want of a better term. Basically I think of the USA, and it's future, and whether it is blackpilled to say so or not, I realize that the inhabitants of the continental united states will trend more diverse over the next century.

Even if all immigration was completely stopped and we had no new immigrants, illegal or otherwise, the future USA would likely still be less white than it is now. And a big reason why is that interracial relationships and marriages are on the rise, and are for the most part even commonplace now. Whether this is white people and black people marrying, or whites and asians, or other racial mixes, it is accepted now and only becoming more common as time goes on. Even if conservative or 'redpilled' attitudes become more accepted and common in the future, I still think that racially the US will become more diverse, or at the very least, there will be more mixed race people.

Looking at the history of the USA, we are largely a mutt nation. Among the white population, most people I know and myself included are mutts. I know few people who are 100% Irish or 100% italian or 100% German, let alone English or Dutch or any other founding stock. In my part of the country, most whites are a mixture of German and Irish for example.

And so I look to the future and see an increase in muttdom for lack of a better term. Hence the title of my post, Mulatto nationalism. If immigration were 100% stopped today, I can foresee a continuing blend of American races, and in many ways producing a new mixed race population that is 100% ""American"". And I also think of prominent mixed race individuals in society and how many of them have been respectable and decent people. I'll partially dox myself here and admit that I am from Kansas City, and we just had a based Texan mulatto named Patrick Mahomes take us to the superbowl, and become the youngest MVP and superbowl champ, as well as the first ""black"" quarterback to win a superbowl. I use black in quotations because Mahomes is obviously mulatto, and by looking at him he looks much more white than the Obama, who was supposedly 50/50 white/black. He's not just a good quarterback but he is an open Christian, supports our troops, stands for the anthem, etc. Basically an inverted version of Colin Kaepernick. Whereas Kaepernick represents the worst traits among mulattos or ""light skinned n***as"", I personally feel that Mahomes represents the best.

Now I know most people here don't care about football or professional sports. In general I don't really care either but when it's your hometown and it's been so long it's hard not to get swept up in what ultimately becomes an expression of civic pride.

I know this entire most may sound cringe and dumb, but I guess my overall point is that when considering Ethnonationalism as a driving fundamental political force of nature, we have to keep in mind that within the USA we are witnessing, for better or worse, the creation of an entirely new ethnos, and that ethnos is mixed race people. I can foresee a future USA in 2050 or 2080 that is heavily composed of mulatto types but is nevertheless fiercely conservative and nationalistic. And I think it would be wise to prepare for this reality. I fear that if we do not adequately prepare for this demographic reality, we will lose and instead of redpilled mulatto nationalism we will have degenerate mulatto socialism, perhaps worse than anything we have ever seen. Anyway, just wanted to get my thoughts down and see what people think.

P.S. Regarding a white ethnostate, I thnk it would be possible, but I don't see it happening in the whole US. Maybe as a breakaway nation of some sort, but in whatever remains of the USA, we will undoubtedly see a more diverse, largely mixed race population. My thoughts on this as of late have brought me around to Trumpian style nationalism. We don't have to accept the idea of ""civic nationalism"" in which anyone from anywhere on earth can be an American nationalist if they just profess it. But for people who's ancestors on both sides have been here for decades or centuries, they should be able to partake in American nationalism and be proud to be an American, even if one half of their ancestry is white and the other half is black, or asian, or hispanic.","&gt;If immigration were 100% stopped today, I can foresee a continuing blend of American races, and in many ways producing a new mixed race population that is 100% ""American"". 

If we stopped immigration today, ended birthright citizenship, deported all undocumented immigrants and revoked the citizenship of any of their anchorbabies (lots of countries do this. we can too.), do not renew the visas of most legal noncitizens, and end affirmative action (at least outside of Indian reservations and a hypothetical African American homeland), we would be back up to nearly 70% of the population. Is all of this going to be done tomorrow? No. Is all of it going to be done within the next 10 years? Amost certainly not. But it can be done. Kazakhs went from being 73.9% of the population of Kazakhstan (and a much higher pre-Russian conquest percentage that we just dont have data on) to merely 30% of the population and back up to 67% of the population today. This is because of mass Russian emigration and higher Kazakh birthrates. Yes, their situation is much different from ours but I still find it inspiring. 

&gt;Looking at the history of the USA, we are largely a mutt nation. Among the white population, most people I know and myself included are mutts. I know few people who are 100% Irish or 100% italian or 100% German, let alone English or Dutch or any other founding stock. In my part of the country, most whites are a mixture of German and Irish for example.

Those groups are mutts too. For example, the English are a mix of Angle, Saxon, Celtic, and Norse. You can say this about literally any ethnic group on the planet if you go back far enough. 

&gt;Ethnonationalism as a driving fundamental political force of nature, we have to keep in mind that within the USA we are witnessing, for better or worse, the creation of an entirely new ethnos, and that ethnos is mixed race people. I can foresee a future USA in 2050 or 2080 that is heavily composed of mulatto types but is nevertheless fiercely conservative and nationalistic. And I think it would be wise to prepare for this reality. I fear that if we do not adequately prepare for this demographic reality, we will lose and instead of redpilled mulatto nationalism we will have degenerate mulatto socialism, perhaps worse than anything we have ever seen. Anyway, just wanted to get my thoughts down and see what people think.

It's not like we become a minority and suddenly it's over. Whites are still going to exist in America and most of us will continue to marry whites. 

&gt;P.S. Regarding a white ethnostate, I thnk it would be possible, but I don't see it happening in the whole US.

A model for America going forward is Russia, which recognizes the existence of other ethnic groups within the country with equal rights and sets aside areas to be homelands for them while also asserting Russian identity as the defining identity of the ~~empire~~ federation. It could be like a soft, mostly culturally-enforced form of segregation. You *can* live outside the African American homeland and don't worry, we will never subject you to the horrors of using separate water fountains, but why would you want to live outside of your homeland? You have affirmative action there, you are surrounded by your people, and you don't have to deal with racists. 

If all else fails, there's always Balkanization, paying them to leave, a one child policy for anyone with over 5% non-European ancestry, and/or forced deportation of citizens who arrived or whose parents or grandparents arrived after 1965. I'm not a fan of these options. I don't really want to put them on the table. They are possibilities though.",1

The term 'melting pot' was not originally used to mean something good; It was meant to show melting down of cultural diversity until there is none; Thus destroying diversity altogether until it's just one mesh of 'American culture' where no one is unique or different; Which isn't a good thing.

As the bottom comment was saying; Whites make up less than 5% of the entire world population and are the 2nd smallest minority (if I recall correctly, behind Indians or Pacific Islanders who have about 1-2%).

White and East Asian countries do far better than brown and black countries, despite the brown and black countries having a head start in many areas; From evolution and science, to resources, and civilizations.  Much of the modern, and future world, would be destroyed or delayed if white people and Asians didn't exist/were bred out of existence.

fi9nhss,Wojak,"Well what about stuff like an inconsistent sleep schedule, negative thoughts/selfpity, lack of hygiene, under or over eating, unhealthy diet, procrastinating, youtube or other social media addiction(or just a general internet/smartphone addiction) which can lead to anxiety/anxiety increase and inability to focus properly + also depression, doing what other people expect of you rather than what you actually wanna do and deep down consider to be the best of you. Are some of these things stuff that you struggle with aswell?

Because if so, then definietly consider what they could be doing to your body and your mind.

Also I just wanna add that if you have trouble falling asleep it could be because of the energy drinks(as the amounts of caffeine in a monster energy drink for instance, stays in your system for about 10-12 hours, resulting in bad sleep quality, same goes for alcohol - even if u feel like u had a good enough sleep you could still be feeling the effects of sleep deprivation - anxiety, depression etc. maybe you just dont notice it as it has become your new normal at this point).

At the same time weed could also be causing you to feel more anxious or paranoid or even depression(usually not while smoking, but rather afterwards, in the longer run so to speak. Although this can also sometimes be experienced while smoking). If you smoke out of moderation this is very likely to happen and it can also cause memory dificts, depersonalisation, brainfog and just overall cognitive deficits. But the scary things is that even if you do only smoke in moderation, you actually can't even tell if it truly is moderation or not. The reason why that is so is because if you live in a state or country where you can't just buy weed legally like in Canada, Colorado or whatever, then you don't know how high the percentage of THC actually is, it could be 4, 14 or even 20%, you dont know. They could also be putting in rat poison(I heard that they sometimes put this in hashis/the brown weed) or in some cases even a bit of heroin, either to save money or get you extra hooked, you don't know.

Anyway, dont wanna spoke ya or anything, but I really just hope that you would consider some of these things.

How do we get around that?  I'm not sure.  I do understand where she is coming from, though - being a homemaker, or rather ""the domestic arts"" can have a lot of power.  The homemaker is a very powerful figure; she controls everyone's diet, she is the de facto healer, she clothes everyone, she might be in charge of maintaining the home's garden... even just food by itself has a LOT of work to it.","A homemaker is dependent on the wage earner's financial contributions to the family though, which puts her in a trapped situation if he up and leaves, cheats, is abusive, has a gambling problem, takes up heavy drinking and gets fired, ends up being a bit dumb and intolerable, etc.

&gt; The alt-right, or alternative right, is a loosely defined group of people with far-right ideologies who reject mainstream conservatism in favor of white nationalism. White supremacist[1] Richard Spencer initially promoted the term in 2010 in reference to a movement centered on white nationalism and did so according to the Associated Press to disguise overt racism, white supremacism, neo-fascism and neo-Nazism.[2][3][4] The term drew considerable media attention and controversy during and after the 2016 United States presidential election.[5]

do2jo7u,Ask_Radical_Feminists,"These are all things I try to do already (and undoubtedly could do more/better), but on some deeper level I just feel like it's a hypocritical waste for me as a man to even try. I still despite my best conscious effort end up objectifying women, devaluing them, mansplaining, etc. Not to mention when it comes to more radical positions regarding heterosexual intercourse, there's a compelling argument to be made that I as a heterosexual male am inherently going to be either a rapist or an ""aspiring"" rapist no matter what I do, just based on my social conditioning within a patriarchal rape culture such as ours. I'm ashamed of my desire for sex, and probably rightfully so. But it's there and it won't go away.

I just feel like there's a fundamental disconnect between what I know on an intellectual level and what my male animal brain will actually accommodate, and that the two will forever be irreconcilable. And I know that these things ultimately do oppress women to the benefit of men, including myself, so I'm aware that it's all extremely unethical of me to contribute to, but there seems to be some primal force preventing me from doing anything else. A lion simply can not become a vegan no matter how well-informed he may be.

From what I know about Marxist class relations and what admittedly little I've learned about women as an oppressed sex-class, it seems like I'm just doomed to be on the ""wrong side"" of this struggle by birth. It makes me feel immense guilt and dread, like I can't trust myself at all, or that I shouldn't exist in the first place. I don't want to be the next story about a male ""ally"" who ends up going full creeper on someone in a ""moment of weakness"" or has an unexpected violent episode or whatever. I've punched walls, slammed my phone on the ground, etc.; I know that male violence is in me. I don't know to what degree I can actually suppress it though, and hearing stories like that one YouTuber recently makes me doubtful. I hear some radfem women say men can not *ever* be feminists, and I tend to think they're right. I've never hit a woman in my life, and yet every male feminist role model inevitably can't seem to help himself. I'd honestly rather die than stoop to that level.

The gaslighting from the alt-right/redpill types doesn't help either, what with them constantly insisting that men only become feminists to get laid. Sometimes I believe them when I hear some of the more mainstream/liberal feminist women make comments like ""consent is sexy"" or the like. I have intrusive thoughts which reflect these abhorrent motives too, and I just want to puke. I resent myself for it, and yet I don't even know if it's really me thinking it on my own or not. Or if that's even a meaningful distinction when it comes down to it.

The worst part for me personally (selfishly of course) is that I feel practically alone. All the men I know personally are stereotypically brainless, misogynist pigs. Third wave libfems are obviously deluded into a consumerist bastardization of feminism, parading around as ""progressive"" or ""intersectional"" while they cheer on violent male trans activists who assault elderly women for daring to assert themselves. Leftist spaces on the internet are dominated by first world white boys with a fetish for violence and who don't seem to grasp the concept of self-criticism (I'm plenty guilty of this in particular). They also *love* to throw the TERF/SWERF stuff around, which means they may as well be liberals where it counts. Radfems rightfully don't want me around because I'm male and I obviously have no place in their movement. I feel like a lonely ant without a hill, just waiting to starve in the space between all the places I'm not welcome.

fbliws,Ask_Radical_Feminists,"If men are the problem, how come lesbian divorce rates are much higher? [removed]","I'm not sure why you're trying to use divorce rates as evidence that their relationships are worse (????)

I feel tired even trying to begin to dismantle this mess 

Do you have any idea how many straight couples literally hate each other but stay together for reasons that might not apply to lesbians? (Wife is afraid of her husband, or they have kids and have been a family together for so long they don't want a change, or they're more traditional people, etc.) 

And even if all of those things didn't apply, I still don't know what your point is because divorce rates are not a measure of quality of life, well being, or even the quality of the relationship seeing as people don't always stay in relationships that are good for them, nor do they always leave ones that are bad.

The hetero wanting to lesbian thing-- I feel like you're referring to something a straight woman might say in frustration. It's not a significant phenomenon that hetero women ""want to be lesbian."" And even if they did want to be lesbian,  a higher divorce rate is not going to counter that-- people aren't all necessarily orienting their lives around marriage. 

And when you say ""guys, if men are the problem den why duz da lezbeens divorce more?!!1"" It's actually hilarious because you're implying that one can measure how much of a problem men are by how frequently they're divorced. Like... what??? What about the ones who never marry? What about the ones who suck and don't get divorced?",2

Which leads me to:

2. Women talking shit against men isn't hate speech. 

However, men's propensity for violence and aggression is THE reason monogamous relationships exist. Why heterosexual coupling exist. And conversely, it's why women AREN'T respected or listened to when they turn men down at bars without being ""claimed"". Why? Because men understand men's ability or potential threat of violence. This isn't about hate speech, because joking about how much better the world would be without men isn't hateful. It's tongue in cheek because men are the biggest threat to women AND men. 

Women getting unruly and mean is how we got the right to vote. I don't know if you think that came about because the suffragettes were so kind and peaceful? But if you think that, you need to do more reading about how violent it actually was. 

Women haven't made any progress in history being nice. What is happening on pinkpill isn't hatespeech. It's satire. Maybe crass, maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but not hatespeech.

Eta- OH you think gender critical is a hate group. That's laughable. Women calling out men is severely not allowed in your worldview.

A man must keep his word, and accept responsibility for his actions and duties

To be willing to change what he has to, to succeed in every aspect of life: 
Occupation, relations, and investment in one’s health
A man must take inventory, and believe in oneself
A man must recognize other men and women as equals

Other negative connotations are the redheaded stepchild, no one wants to adopt redheads, redheads are often bullied and ostracized, they sunburn, have allergies, etc. Will they recreate the movies with red headed villains cast as black actors too? I understand the choice for swapping black people into roles where redheads are supposed to be the ""other"" and now black people are the ""other"", but being a natural redhead is in itself isolating in different terms. They don't have communities of other gingers they congregate with. Even in Ireland and Scotland there are those that think that gingers are disgusting.

&gt;we should defund/deport shitty people, regardless of nationality or color.

What if we figure out that it's cheaper to just outlaw Africans, Central Americans, lower caste Indians, nonwhite Brazilians, etc. instead of looking for a diamond in the rough, whose offspring will regress to the mean IQ of his ethnicity anyway?

What if we decide economy is not as important as social stability? For example, [the largest study](http://ge.tt/1vpo0HU1/v/0) ever conducted on civic engagement demonstrated that racial diversity creates unhappiness and a lower perceived quality of life.

&gt;When the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, they showed that the more people of different races lived in the same community, the greater the loss of trust. They don’t trust the local mayor, they don’t trust the local paper, they don’t trust other people and they don’t trust institutions. The only thing there’s more of is protest marches and TV watching.

Free movement of labor and resources are good for *some* people, i.e., elites, but is it good for the average American worker? No.

[Why not be more like Japan?](http://www.vdare.com/articles/federale-in-japan-it-works-and-it-could-work-in-the-us-too)

&gt;The American economy is increasingly infested by low-paid aliens. In contrast, Japan’s economy is structured for ordinary Japanese workers to prosper.

&gt;Japan is, besides the land of the rising sun, the land of the mini-markets. But, unlike the United States, convenience stores are not dominated by immigrants, nor are those stores marketed to the poor, located in dangerous ghettos, or restricted to the interstates. Convenience stores are located throughout Japan, including up-scale neighborhoods. These stores are staffed and owned by native Japanese. No surly service, no communications problems, at least for the Japanese, and especially no worries about being gunned down by black or Hispanic gangsters.

Sounds nice to me!","&gt;What if we figure out that it's cheaper to just outlaw Africans, Central Americans, lower caste Indians, nonwhite Brazilians, etc. instead of looking for a diamond in the rough, whose offspring will regress to the mean IQ of his ethnicity anyway?

We already have a citizenship test. Would it be so unworkable to incorporate ""g-loaded"" measures?  Or, we could just create a program similar to H1B visas -- allow accomplished professionals, regardless of their origin.  This would have the natural effect of screening out most lower-class immigrants and admitting those diamonds in the rough.  

To me, barring some cataclysmic instability, prosperity is more important.  I agree with you that a mono-ethnic nation might be more socially stable, but honestly?  If we were populated 100% by a mix of native-born achievers plus H1B doctors, engineers and web developers, I do not envision Ferguson-esque riots happening. If we deported some white welfare leeches from Mississippi, I don't think anything of value would be lost.  

Japan is always an interesting contrast in discussions like these, but I also find the UAE and Qatar to be useful.  There, pretty much anyone can immigrate...at least for the purpose of providing cheap labor.  It's in some respects a libertarian economist's dream.  Getting citizenship is harder, though.  I would be curious to explore a model like that, except the obstacle to citizenship would be something IQ- or achievement-related, versus a willingness to convert to Islam and live in a totalitarian state.",1

It doesn't help that my Mum got a UTI the last time she went (same GP's office!), I can't say it fills me with confidence! I've never been with men, but have been with a couple of women who have.

I tried to book a test with my GP the other day, but it was a 3 week wait - and through my stupid health anxiety, I couldn't work out when my next period was at that moment on the phone, so said I'd get back to them. (I was actually calling them about an unrelated blood test form and spontaneously decided this was the time to book it! I need to get a grip!)

6l5vly,race,"if I were black would I see my experience as an example of racism? I saw a trailer that is attached to the new Jay z album 4:44. I don't have tidal, so I can't watch the video, but that story the lawyer is telling at the begining didn't necessarily have to do with racisim. I don't deny that racisim is an ongoing issue in America, but I do ask myself how we can define wether somthing is racist or not. For example I share a story very similar to his; I was a temp at a factory, one of the last few places in the area where you could get a wage decent enough to be able to afford rent/living expenses and maybe save some money. I would see guys at work who had houses and were only 20yrs old, they had cars nicer than anything I could ever let myself drem of owning and they never worked the overtime shift. People would whisper about the wages real employees got in the lunch room, everybody was hopeful they'd be next and some people had been temping for three years at minimum wage. I told myself that I was going to get there by working as hard as I could. I accepted every bit of overtime they had, I took pieces into the lunch room to practise more efficent ways to assemble parts, I filled in at every section of the factory. They were very receptive and kept giving me more responsibility, more complex tasks and more overtime. I was told by managers I had excelled faster than anyone they had ever seen. My personal life was suffering, but I told myself it was worth it. It had been months but the day finally came and they announced they were going to hire a new employee. I was estatic I knew it was going to be me, I could propose, maybe start a family with my girlfriend. My life could start and my struggles would be over. They announced the new employee and he had worked their for a week. He was very immature and didn't seem to realize what a blessing the situation was. I didn't give up though, I thought that he must have had some college, or something else I didn't and I would just have to work harder to show my abilities and ambition. In the mean time, my father had taken off on my mother and was missing. My mom was hysterical thinking that he was in trouble. I live with my girlfriend an hour or so away from my mom and my girlfriend was comforting my mom while I worked. I poured more and more of myself into the job, thinking it could just take care of everything if I was making enough money to pay my moms bills while my dad was gone, take care of my girlfriend etc. Again, I was told how awesome smart and useful I was almost daily. The bosses were becoming chatty with me, they would give me special tasks and I knew that this time it was real. The new guy quit and they were hiring a new employee and again I was feeling relieved. They passed me over again, for another guy who had worked there three weeks. I exploded and told them if they didn't hire me on the spot I'd quit. They told me if I really felt that way to hand in my card and uniform at the end of the day. A older fellow who temped there approached me and told me not to quit, he had battled cancer, but lost his business in the process of treatment as he couldn't tend to it. He said he was going to get hired soon and he'd get me in when he did. I asked him how long he'd worked there and he said three years. I didn't finish my shift. I found out later the older fellow quit under similar circumstances not long after. The biggest insult was when I ran into the some of the managers with a few employees and the new guy at the bar, I guess they were friends. Everybody told me after they only hire family and friends.
My point is, if I were black and the media is telling me all the time I am being held back because I am black, would I see that as racism? Would I have seen myself on the outside because of race? It would seem reasonable, but be untrue. If you believe in microagressions and subtle racism being everywhere do you begin to see it everywhere?
Again, I have witnessed and heard racism. I have ceased friendships over racism I know it exists, I know its real and damaging. I just don't know if everything is always racism","I'm not sure what you are asking... is this situation racism or is this situation discrimination? Not all discrimination is racism but all discrimination not based on merit is bad.

""Everybody told me after they only hire family and friends.""

This is clearly not racism because you specified it was nepotism. Microaggression is a misnomer to what people of color experience. Because you get screwed out of a job you busted your butt for is worthy of anger and emotion and if it was me I may suspect race has something to do with it however that is solely a suspicion and doesn't prove or condemn me or the company. I'm sorry you didn't leave sooner. You should have seen that something screwed up was going on. The microaggressions you were experiencing were valid too btw so remember that as well. You might be more aware of nepotism the next time you face it. Is it wrong for you to be more aware of it and quick to act the next time?

You can sue for nepotism as well. 

And racism is learned through experience. Just as you mentioned it's there. It's so embedded that you can attribute the word subtle, however subtle doesn't mean light, soft, mediocre. Subtle means covert, unconscience, and inconspicuous. So be aware when you describe racism. From you attaching the word subtle I would infer you lack the understanding of the true impact racism has on people.

I think the rhetoric of racism has become so common that people discredit it when it does happen, as well as people miscredit it when it hasn't but the bigger question is the injustice. Are you taught that injustice happens so deal with it or do you think justice for all and speak up when that falls short?",0

- In June 1945 interrogation states he was sent to Chelmno in March 1944. During the Eichmann trial in 1961 he said the date was near the end of 1943. Mattogno: ""What is certain is that there was at that time no one in Chelmno.""

- As a 13 year-old, he was selected for special work kommandos and survived the ""death camp"" for at least 13 months.

- In 1961 claimed 1000-1200 arrived for extermination daily, for nine months (i.e. between 270,000 and 324,000). However, he stated in his 1945 interrogation that 700-1000 people arrived every second day, and that 15,000 were killed.

- Claimed in 1945 that a van parked in the grounds of the Ostrowski company was one of the ""gas vans"" used -- the Central Commission of Inquiry inspected the vehicle and established it wasn't a ""gas van"".

7zz9e8,Infowars,Anyone know what model is Alex's microphone? Was thinking about getting one,"The brand is ""Electro-Voice."" Without seeing it up-close, I'm not sure if it's the original model or one of their updates. (I'm pretty sure I've seen all 3 of these ""RE"" series variants on-set.)



The old-school industry standard model is an **RE20** which runs a little over $400 new. 





They also make a couple of updated versions, the **RE320** which is around $300 new. Also there is the **RE27N/D** around $500 new, which has a NeoDymium magnet cartridge for a little more high-end and more EQ-switching options.



The shockmount that fits any of these is the **309 A Shockmount,** $99 or so new. These mikes do come with a plain stand adapter clip, so this suspension mount is nice but not mandatory.




The [**RE20 (click for moar info)**](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/RE20) is matte grey, I know I have seen him use this mike at some point. I am very familiar with this one, and have used it myself for many years. By design, it has minimal ""proximity effect:"" it **does not** boost low-end when you get close, as most dynamic mikes tend to do. This works very well for broadcast purposes, as the low-end is consistent regardless of how close/not close you are to the mike. 




The [**RE27N/D**](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/RE27) has a shiny finish, this one has more output/high end. It also has the ""no proximity effect"" design. (It is also the most expensive of the three.)




The [**RE320**](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/RE320--electro-voice-re320) is black, this looks to be what he was using on yesterday's show. (Also a ""no proximity effect"" design.) This is the cheapest of the three. 




\&gt;also



They are using a special ""pop filter"" made specifically for that mike, [**similar to this.**](http://www.popfilter.com/re20.htm) The RE20 has a very good pop filter built-in, so this may/may not be necessary. 




\&gt;also



The good news: all three of these are ""dynamic"" mikes, and do not require phantom power (as studio ""condenser"" mikes need.) Any mixer with an XLR input will work, no external preamp required.  ",0

e52m3si,Ask_Radical_Feminists,"In terms of practical political strategy, I have the unpopular opinion that men will not change, and we need to accept it. They will not change. Not with the right ""education"" (""woke"" men still hate women), not with the right parenting, not with us pleading our humanity. Women have tried all of those things for as long as patriarchy existed, yet men have not stopped raping, beating, harassing, intimidating, dehumanizing, and reviling women. 

Most men watch porn, will defend it to their death, and openly admit that they do not care if there's a chance that the women they masturbate to are being raped. Their orgasms and ego are much more important than women's right to not be raped, and the eroticized male sexual aggression towards and domination over women is part of their orgasms and ego trips anyway. This is the reality we are dealing with here. It’s not just a few men, it’s the majority. 

They tell us that prostitution is inevitable because there will always be a ""demand,"" and they see nothing wrong with telling women that men will demand to have sex with women, so we better set aside a class of women for them to rape.

The examples are, without exaggeration, endless. Point is, since we cannot appeal to male *empathy*, we need to stop supplying them with the *material resources* they gain from our oppression. We need to have separatist communities first of all. And we need to have real discussions about cutting ties with men, refusing to sleep with men, refusing to procreate, refusing to put our bodies, time, and money into misogynistic cultural institutions.

39sg7e,DebateFascism,"Question regarding purity and decadence of society. Fascism always had a central idea of ""purity"". I would like it clarified. I also desire to know what you consider decadent behaviour, why and why that is harmful to society.","Good question.

Fascism had an idea of new man, one which would be rooted in ground (on past traditions) but would always look into future. 

I will quote Evola:


&gt;“For the authentic revolutionary conservative, what really counts is to be faithful not to past forms and institutions, but rather to principles of which such forms and institutions have been particular expressions, adequate for a specific period of time and in a specific geographical area.” 

Decadent behaviour would be any kind of behaviour that when engaged in longer periods does not contribute to anything but to a pleasure of body. So think of it as promiscuity, excessive drinking, sloth, wasting time on video games. It is harmfull because it promotes atomization.

Fascist should always think on society first and foremost, healthy society is composed by healthy individuals. Behaviour that help society and establishes personal bonds should be considered good and pure.

So, we charge each country we ""defend."" That sounds great. Let's imagine Japan and Saudia Arabia buy in--defense budget problems: solved. Then, Russia and China say they want our protection, too. So, who gets our services? What happens when paying countries (or ""clients"") have ""disagreements"" with each other? What if an aggressor (say, Russia) can afford ""protection"" and a financially weaker country (Ukraine) can't? 

Think what regional wars already do to our economy and imagine if we were being paid by both (or all) sides.

Back to Trump's point. There's a difference between being Global Police (solving every country's internal conflict) and being the Global Leader (protecting countries from other countries). The problem is that countries who need Global Police can rarely afford it, and the risk of ""refusal of service for lack of payment,"" to countries who want to protect themselves from aggressors puts us all at risk for global instability.

So, the harder question becomes: Does America's Foreign Defense Policy Need Revenue, Or Leadership?",We don't even solve problems though. Just end up interfering and creating more.,0

d9uwr3k,The_Europe,"Hi ! Praise Kek !

Basically:

- Leaving the European Union and Shengen space (free movement accross Europe of people and goods)

- Abandon the single currency (Euro) and go back to national currency (Franc). 

- On their latest flyers they were talking about ""reversing"" immigration, which is probably the soft way of saying ""deportation"". Needless to say, immigration will be heavily regulated. Strong borders.

- Generalized protectionism. ""Préférence Nationale""

- Anti-Establishment twist.  

- Militarily non-interventionist (I might be kinda wrong on this one, need to check)

- Very conservative on ethical and social issues (abortion, LGBT rights, Christianity, family values, national identity, recreational drugs...). This might be where they largely differ from Trump in my opinion. While Trump has made somewhat conservative statements about abortion, he's largely liberal on the other issues. For the Front National it's a different story. This might also be in a certain way a deal breaker for many people, especially young people, when it comes to actually choosing an alternative to the UMP(Les Républicains)/PS duo (which is analogical to your republican and democrat parties). Front National remains ""scary"" in that sense, but it is the only tool the citizens have so far for voicing their protest against the establishment. There's also far left and green parties but they don't pack as much of a punch as FN.


I believe we need to emulate the Trump phenomenon here in France (and everywhere else in Europe for that matter). Some guy, non-politician, needs to come out of the blue and speak directly to the people, from the people, obliterate political correctness, and be a true beacon of change while not treading heavily on social/ethical issues. We need Trump in Europe. Badly. Politicians can only hack it so far and people are sick of them.

It helped a lot of Bernie supporters cross over, liberals, and what we call libertarians here in America. I would imagine that would be even more necessary in France.

e0ak7e5,DebateAltRight,"&gt; I don’t really see why this is a problem. I don’t have an issue with countries that are nearly entirely homogenous trying to keep their demographics stable through citizenship policy. But once there’s a 10, 20, 30%+ minority population it’s racist and oppressive to restrict immigration and citizenship racially because it makes minorities second class citizens. Race is a social construct anyways so I really don’t care whether people from a different arbitrary category overtake white people demographically. Countries like the UK and especially the US can’t just go back to being a whites-only type of country.
 
No you clearly have a problem when white countries want to stay homogeneous thats the issue and hypocrisy at hand here. America and Europe did for most of its history have restrictive immigration polices to keep the demographic order in check. In fact most on countries on earth still do this ignoring current idiotic policies of western nations. Europe still has a chance to deport and revert its demographics the US I agree is pretty much fucked. The best we can do is balkanize and have certain homogeneous white states separate. Race isn't social construct unless you think classification of different subspecies of animals and difference genetic clustering is not real which I mean you can believe in the fairly tale if want. Franz Boas pseudoscientific thought has pretty ruined Western Anthropology. Luckily most of worlds Anthropology outside the west calls out Boasian anthropology for the horseshit it is. 

&gt;Also, no one is forcing white countries to become multicultural. The countries with diverse immigration policies voted for it democratically. There are tons of white liberal anti-racists who vote for those kinds of things. Who are you to say only your perspective of white interests is correct? 
 
How are we not forced to be multicultural. Lets see from day one children are indoctrinated with radical egalitarianism, white guilt, cultural relativism, etc.. Nobody is allowed to question the negatives of multiculturalism or even have a discussion about it, we just have to assume that its way better than a fully unified homogeneous nations somehow. Not mention there have been countless studies done even by liberals who were shocked by the mainly negative results of multiculturalism. Anyone who is against is immediately cast a heretic, possibly fired from work, or even physical threat by social justice mobs. This is happening to basic bitch conservatives or centrists on a large scale not even the alt right.      

&gt;I’ve never seen or heard anything that could be described as anti white hatred. If you think that white people in America experience racism you’d never survive as a black or brown person. The only thing that can explain someone thinking white people are somehow oppressed in white dominated countries is an enormous victim complex. 

Lol even non white civic nationalists are noticing mainstream blatant anti white hatred this isn't some alt right conspiracy or something the alt right has just noticed. You're either blind or deliberately gaslighting me. Terms like white privilege which are commonly pushed in leftist academia are common vague anti white self loathing propaganda terms to demonize a people. Jews, East Asians and South Asians outperform whites in a lot of categories in life do they have this privilege? Anyways I can list a lot with multiple mainstream professors calling for white genocide, to posters in camps calling white DNA an abomination, anti white dog whistles like diversity(code for less whites), its ok to be white is somehow evil, etc.. I mean even fuckin liberal Jewish professor like Bret Weinstein experienced blatant anti white actions in his college and people threatened him with violence for speaking out against it. Just because white progressives are actively cheering it on doesn't mean shit. Ever heard of uncle toms or people who hate themselves?  

&gt;White people will be treated fine, don’t you see lots of white people marching with BLM in mass protests? If whites were so hated by minorities wouldn’t they be kicked out of those events? 

BLM has kicked out whites or called for whites to be kicked out of events plenty of times lol. 


&gt;If you think that white people in America experience racism you’d never survive as a black or brown person. 

Just walk down a black neighborhood in LA and see how they'll treat you. Anyways no I have no sympathy of spoiled minorities in America. They average way higher income than most poor Eastern European countries let a lone the rest of the world and have a better standard of living than most of the world. My parents are from war torn Yugoslavia and have experienced poverty and suffering. Same with my ancestors who experience actual oppression under Ottomans and fought for their independence while blacks try get gibs from whites and try to forcefully live with whites. People who are actually oppressed don't want to live with their oppressors which is intimidate red flag of the black oppression narrative in America. Heck even under segregation in 1900s blacks still had better income and standard of living than the most of Europe let alone the world they just didn't have as high income as white Americans. Lynchings were also not common at all contrary to popular belief. 

&gt;The US does not belong to white people, it belongs to whoever lives here regardless of their race. 

What makes you say soo? The US was built by Europeans for Europeans. The founding fathers always wanted this nation to have a European character. It was a Pan European nation for most of its history until 1965.   

&gt;The overwhelming majority of rapes and murders happen between people of the same race. Statistically speaking white people should try not to live around white people if you’re advocating separation :) 

I was talking about the targeted white killings in South Africa however your stats are semi true but not fully. People still generally live in areas with there own race which why there is a higher chance of same race crime stats committed on each other however blacks still disproportionately commit more crime for their population numbers. Also whites are not that safe around [blacks](https://ii.yuki.la/1/d2/81f7af88260e9c5331d7f80e5fe9275f84c1e3a94457e26659b9fa395a0dbd21.jpg).   


&gt;It’ll probably be a much better country, POC vote for welfare state policies at a much higher rate so we’ll probably get things like universal free healthcare, free education, etc.  

Well Europe even before mass immigration was pretty left wing economically. The alt right in general is pretty left wing economically. That said in welfare state in a multicultural society is impossible and disastrous due to many different peoples with different needs clashing with one another. Also the only reason POC vote for welfare policies is because of those sweet gibs.  

&gt;Actually we are winning the propaganda war. The US is more integrated and tolerant than any time in history. The youth are more progressive, diverse, and less racist than older generations. 

Again when they passed the Hart-Celler Act they told white Americans this was merely a symbolic bill that wouldn't change the demographics of the country. This was an obvious lie. Anways no shit liberals and progressives have winning they've been winning for over 60s years. It isn't hard to win when you have the Overton Window, entertainment industry, media, education, politics(until Trump), etc.. all on your side. Even your mainstream opponents conservatives and centrists today are cowards who are scared of being called racist or bigot and aren't conserving anything. They're just fiscal conservatives but liberal socially. I wouldn't say the youth are less racist my friend minorities are more ethnocentric and nationalistic as ever. Whites are either self loathing liberal cucks that hate there own people/have extreme case of xenophila or coward race blind conservatives harping about individualism while non whites march for their groups interests and political power.  

&gt;A lot of cultural enrichment and increased diversity has happened since the Hart-Cellar Act, so the culture is changing faster than ever before. 

Lol you can stop the anti white dog whistles I know what you mean you want to country to be less European and more of a mixed mess. European culture is not rich enough apparently so when need to import backwards third world cultures. Heres the problem with your insane ideas. It is literally impossible to have a liberal democrat values in a country filled with non white third worlders. This is the same mistake idiotic civic nationalists think. Peoples politics and value systems are connected to there genetics as well not just upbringing. Why do think liberal democrat values only developed in western nations(which inspired by the enlightenment values) and not other parts of the world? Culture, politics, etc.. is directly linked to blood(peoples).

A few months ago, I was staying with my grandma. She's an ass, so I just figured it would be a long 2 days. It was the second day and then I  went to go get breakfast. I don't remember what it was, I think it was pancakes. A few minutes later, I went out to get some fresh air. She was smoking, she always does. (This might be my second post but most of my stories will be full of smokers because that's my family.) I started to talk. G - grandma and M - Me

G:""What are you doing?""

M:""Nothing, why?""

Keep in mind, I had just woke up, it was nine-ish am and I was not going to deal with any shit from my vicious 50-60 year old grandma. She's not that bad but she's bad to the point where my mom won't let me over there anymore.

G:""Get changed."" *She said in an angry tone of voice like she was angry at me.*

At this point, I just did it. I walked outside with my t-shirt and pants. The shirt had a rainbow that said ""Getting Over It"" on it over the rainbow. My mom bought me that and a shirt that had a rainbow coming out of a pocket to my left. She had known that I was gay, so that was her way of showing she supported me. I think most parents do this at least in my town.

M:""Ok, I did."" 

G:""You know that's a (fucking) gay shirt, right?"" 

At this point my brain cells commited suicide. I stared at her like I wanted to stab her fifty times. I didn't want to, but you get my point.

M:""No.."" I told her trying to lie.

G:""Really? Don't wear that.""

In my mind I was about to scream at her everything that she just said is wrong and she is a bad person, but, I neglected my urge. I messaged my mom to pick me up right now. I'm not allowed to swear but I would have if I could have. I told her the situation and she said if it happened last night why didn't she tell me and I told her it just happened. Well, I haven't seen her without my mom again.

432eet,europeannationalism,"Incredible Insight about SJW culture &gt;I'd recommend reading the history of the Frankfurt School.  Frankly this stuff sounds like a conspiracy theory when you don't hear it from the horses mouth.

&gt;But [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6c_dinY3fM) does a reasonable job of presenting the concept in context.  Hold your nose for the first few minutes - the guy is rather partisan, but there's a point to his buildup.  But his breakdown of critical theory and political correctness is spot-on.

&gt;In short: 'Critical Theory' is taking society's healthy willingness for self-reflection and improvement, and hijacking that immune system into an auto-immune disease.  Repeatedly criticize every facet of society. Make society responsible for every current and past wrong.  **Never demand a solution, just criticize.  Criticize until a secular sense of original sin - that we are born guilty and dirty and oppressive - is worked into the mindset of the culture itself.**

&gt;Keep it up for a few decades.  Once you work this reflexive guilt and self-derision of the culture *into* the culture, people will naturally push it on it's own.  It's like a cancer.  The result is Political Correctness, and at the extreme end, the SJW crowd.  Nobody *dictates* what is politically correct or not.  It's not a grand conspiracy with evil people in the shadows.  It's just an insidious attitude of thought that propagates itself once started.  Because there's always a moral high-ground, and status to be gained, from being *oh so smart* enough to criticize one's own society.

&gt;The end goal being to have the culture undermine it's own validity - attack its root morality from all sides until the culture implodes on itself. Paving the war for a communist revolution *yadda yadda yadda stupid communist ideas yadda yadda yadda.*

&gt;**Whether it accomplishes their goal or not is irrelevant , the devastating effects of turning a culture in on itself are real enough.** Even though I personally hate Trump -  it's pretty obvious why headlines like the one from this thread bump up his popularity.  He's promising to be the Radiation; the Chemotherapy.  The horrible pill we hold our nose with and take, in the hopes that it kills the malignant mutated part of the culture without killing the whole damn society.

cklbqp,Radical_Feminists,"How can radical feminism be implemented? FYI Reposted from askradfems

Hello all,

I have been researching and being active in radical feminist discussion online (mainly on twitter) for around a year. I agree with nigh on every part of what I have read. The part I struggle with is how can radical feminism be practically implemented.

From my understanding liberal feminism is seeking to change things within the current system and radical feminism wants a new system unsullied by patriarchy (please correct me if I've got the wrong end of the stick).

However the activism by radfems I've seen (sex-segregated spaces, equal pay, ending violence against women, anti-fgm etc etc.) would fit the definition of liberal feminism as they advocate for change within the current system.

My black and white thinking imagines knocking down parliament and literally starting from scratch.

Could someone try and explain this to me please?","Ban pornography, adopt Nordic model (criminalise John's) - both a good start, and both unpopular with liberal feminism.",0
d0w0fpy,RedPillWomen,"5'2'' and 90 lbs here:

1.  Tailor your work outfits to fit you.
2.  Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Hollister have recently started taking off their logos off of their clothing...their dresses, sweaters, etc. are honestly excellent.  I just don't tell anyone where I got them.  Also I have tank tops from them but I try to get the ones where the little bird is on the bottom so I can cover it with a high waisted skirt.
3.  You might fall into the Charlotte Russe/Forever 21/H&amp;M trap because their stuff runs small.  Some of this stuff looks REALLY cheap and I advise just not getting it, though you can find some good finds if you're just looking for staples (white tees, pants).
4.  I get white v-necks from Aeropostale, and skirts and stuff from PacSun.
5.  Anne Taylor Loft (petites) for work clothes- then get them tailored.
6.  Tobi is good for more looser fitting styles but I find their xs skirts are even sometimes a bit too big- their xs dresses fit though.
7.  Ralph Lauren xs sweaters and 00 button downs are also great for work.
8.  If I'm not at work I like to wear leggings as pants sometimes with heeled boots and then a tight fitting tank and cardigan.  It definitely makes me look taller.
9.  Victoria's Secret makes great pushup bras and PUSHUP SWIMSUITS.  You need those like yesterday.",*GREAT* list! Thanks so much for this!,0
fvihu9a,RightwingLGBT,"Their ignorance of history hurts me on a spiritual level. ""What if we enslaved white people, how would you like that?""

gn2xg96,aznidentity,I'm with you man. Opinions be opinions. Public discourse better than private. If anything the post itself gets a convo going and may even help the cause. I see hate in some of these replies and it's worrying.,"Like it's one thing if a publication hides opinion as journalism. (e.g. all those sensationalist headlines you see)

&amp;#x200B;

But if there's a big f'ing OPINION tag before the piece, one should be able to discern that it's just opinion and doesn't have any factual basis of standard reporting.

&amp;#x200B;

However, it is worrying (and has been for a long time) that a significant amount of the US population doesn't understand or care to understand what the opinion tag is meant to describe, and that is one of the key contributors to anti-Asian racism that we see everyday.",2

e4t9z3t,AganistGayMarriage,"Evolution created two sexes for them to reproduce, seems a bit unnatural for me that mankind suddenly decides otherwise","Both of the assertions here are false.

1. Homosexuality and bisexuality are both prominent in nature, and they are most prominent in social species for a few reasons.
2. Mankind didn’t just decide otherwise, it took a very long time for mankind to acknowledge that gay people aren’t just people with psychological disorders that needed to be treated. It took even longer for them to do anything about it.

There exists a pretty good hypothesis on why homosexual animals exist. It was found that when you limit a resource necessary to the sustainability of a population, over time the number of homosexuals in that population increases. In social species homosexuals are growth limiters, they stop us from breeding too quickly for our resources to compensate. 

Now human beings have altered the way they deal with growth limiters but that doesn’t make it any less natural.

There’s a reasonably good argument that bisexual people behave as buffers, ensuring that all heterosexuals have a mate, while homosexuals don’t just run out completely.",2

67ngdk,MGTOW,"The bs of antiMGTOW... I don't get it, but then again, it is because it isn't logical, it is Pathos, not Logos... However still, it amazes me how people have a shit fit over the fact that a lot of Men just won't buy into relationships anymore because more and more Men discover it just doesn't benefit Men. It isn't as if MGTOW is overly aggressive in attacking everything nonMGTOW. Sure their are the few bitter Men out their, but for the most part I have seen a lot of civil well thought out discussion in MGTOW communities that are far more welcoming and warm to each other than most any other kinds of groups online. I don't think the MGTOW movement is loud and abrasive. I don't think it deserves the ire it gets by its actions and standing.

The hate still flows though. I attribute that to the fact that those haters will not admit what they fear, that MGTOW is pulling the thread that begins to undo the power structure Women have over Men. The Men that hate are nothing more than an example of Stockholm Syndrome. They won't be honest with themselves over how unbalanced and bs relationships and Womens behavior has become. They fear MGTOW cause it is change, it is growing, and they can't stop it. MGTOW has no head. It is a collection of voices gathering to enrich those who found themselves lost and at the mercy of todays culture, and no longer find reason to invest themselves into the game, but find reason to invest in themselves.

I think MGTOW has saved lives. The change has become the idea of a life lived without the rhetoric of needing to have a family, be married... be useful to Women. I think it gives Men the idea that there is another option, and therefore saving some from falling into a trap of depression, because they never thought one could find fulfillment in just themselves, in loving themselves, and in investing in themselves.

I don't see bs coming from MGTOW. I see bs being thrown at MGTOW. I for one look forward to seeing MGTOW grow. More hate will come as more whom fear change, fear loss of power, see that MGTOW won't die, and can't die.",Exactly.

5ux151,Infowars,"My experience listening to the radio show for the first time. So while I enjoy Alex Jones memes and PJW's videos, I had never really sat down and listened to the entire radio show before. I decided  to listen to his whole show the other day for kicks, but to give it a fair shot. 

While I definitely don't believe a lot of the stuff he says, I will admit I found myself captivated. He was so passionate about what he was saying - and I started to get emotionally invested, even though I don't subscribe to his theories. I have to admit - clearly he has been doing radio for a long time and is quite talented at it. His 21 years of experience shows.

Ever see the movie Terminator Salvation? Where everyone is huddled around the radio listening to John Connor? The show made me feel like I was a member of the Resistance - getting a critically important transmission and getting instructions on how to fight the Evil globalists. Like humanity was in the 11th hour, and only by buying his special tooth paste can I defeat  the Satan worshipping demons who walk the Earth in human disguises. Almost like I was hearing something I wasn't supposed to. Something the evil, frog gayifiying GLOBALISTS would shut down if they had the chance.

Seriously, I found the show bizzarely entertaining. Too many commercials tho. I have to give Jones credit - the guy has strong opinions and isn't afraid to share them. He's a hard worker and confident as hell, and I have to respect that.","so, i listen to what he says, and as well as for entertainment, I hear him read a headline or a direct ""google search it "" to at least see where he gets his news. He relies heavily on Drudgereport,com for his headliners and then a piece from MSM to balance it. If you research any headline he throws out, you will find the source of his ravings and have an opportunity to decide for yourself. The fact that he pushes blue tooth paste, or survival wipes, he is no different than fox news breaking into an urgent &gt;What's in YOUR safe?&lt; pitch for buying gold and silver... ",0

ecle9j5,MensRights,"&gt; we'll either discover

That's a false dichotomy.  

For the majority of offensive ideas, it is easily provable that they are objectively wrong.  (Think ideas like extreme racism or hate).   In those situations, the person holding the offensive idea is unlikely to change their view when presented with evidence that it is wrong.

Engaging in civil discussion with these people is a waste of time.  They have no intention, and oftentimes no ability to change their mind.  And, for some, when you challenge their beliefs directly, they clamp down on their ideas and further reject new information.

&gt; What helps no one is silencing one side, since those ideas are now denied to everyone.

But many of the controversial ideas are offensive because they are based on lies, twisted facts, or deceptive logic that many people are not equipped to understand.  To this end, by allowing the offensive ideas room to breathe, through civil engagement, you are helping it spread.  Many fallacies are very difficult to prove or explain to people, and many lies take an enormous amount of specific knowledge to disprove.

Ideas like racism can be presented in a very seductive way through statistics or quasi-logical means: ""X group commits Y% of crime even though they are only Z% of the population.""  ""Supporting X is a slippery slope to supporting Y.""","This a 100%. 

I’ll add that a lot of time we simply don’t have time to engage with an argument and determine its truth. For example, if I have cancer and I’m at the doctor and someone pitches essential oils at me as a treatment, it’s obvious that’s a bad idea. But how much time is lost if I engage with that idea and work to dispel it? Time that I could be getting better treatment. 

What if I actually become convinced it is a better treatment? 

The type of reasoning described by Mill is why we suddenly have antivaxxers and every asshole with an internet connection claiming to be an expert in everything.",2
gmwwk41,conspiracy,"Well there is another option: You can still choose to not receive the mark. But you will likely die for refusing. Either you will be killed or die from starvation because you are not able to buy or sell. 

But alas, hope:

Revelation 20:4 “And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them. Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.”

Those who refuse the mark may die, but if they die in the name of Jesus, they shall have eternal life. God did not abandon us. It is according to His plan.","how can you choose to not receive the mark if all are caused to receive it? it sounds like we are all getting marked. which means i think there's a deeper interpretation here. i mean, jesus even said [kingdom of god](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Luke%2017:21) is within and gods will be done on earth as it is in heaven. that means we have the power to create heaven on earth bc it comes from within us. 

check out aaron abke's mystical jesus and then some of his other bible related stuff. i also just found brian scott and hes done videos on edgar cayce's interpretation of revelation. i had already been thinking about the stuff abke mentioned before i watched his videos and it just makes more sense after watching. ""eyes to see and ears to hear"" ya know? i just cant figure out what the mark really is. id been thinking its AI, and that's my main conclusion, but i wonder if maybe its something else. 

also, 1000 years is not eternal. and im partial to thinking jesus was in an altered state of consciousness. like self actualization as maslow calls it. if you know a bit about psychology, philosophy, eastern teachings, and see how religions all sorta tie into each other, the bible is a much deeper book. its not even that big of a leap to say that.  if jesus was god, man, and holy spirit, and we can all be filled with the holy spirit as man, then we are also god just as jesus was. the apocalypse is the unveiling, or perhaps great awakening, and i think the 7 seals being broken are the 7 chakras opening, and the rapture is the ascension of consciousness, or self actualization. 666 as a synchronicity/angel number is actually a good one that says to wake up to your higher nature. also, hell is Norse; Hel. jesus was talking about Gehenna in the original texts which was a physical location where they would throw trash and bodies of criminals to burn outside the city walls. also consider Jesus' teachings in the language of 1st century people. lots of metaphors bc they didnt have the language we do now. shit, even aliens are in the bible. its not the book mainstream christianity makes it seem is what im saying.",0

cmda8l3,ferguson,"I didn't claim that it was a racist situation. I'm claiming that the matter runs much deeper than just the situation with Michael Brown...

It has to do with the current state of affairs regarding poverty, a lack of quality education, profiling (outside of the Michael Brown case), police brutality in general and an apathetic, hostile perception by much of society which is largely based on stereotypes, greed and racism.

Most of the black people I know are productive upstanding members of society.

","It's racist because the blacks who are out there rioting (at worst) and posting to facebook about how awful life is (at best) are making this a black and white issue.  They're using Mike Brown as a martyr.  He's not a martyr. He's just another thug who got shot for being a thug.

But because the officer was white, and he was black, the black folks have to turn this into a racist issue.  

And I get you're point, that it's not really a racist issue, but it is how they are directing their frustration with being poor and feeling like they are being ""kept down by the (white) man"".  

And AGAIN, I point to you that this is also misdirected anger.  They do this to themselves.  And any time a white person says this,  and don't explicitly agree with them, then they're labelled racist.  

&gt; Most of the black people I know are productive upstanding members of society.

How many of them are speaking up and saying Michael Brown was shot dead because 1) he attacked a police officer which is why he was shot the first time and 2) he was shot dead after first fleeing, and then acting in a way that made the officer believe he was charging at him.

e79tb1n,GenderCynicalCritical,"I think there is a third interpretation that kinda falls between the two. Accept your body. Appreciate it for what it is. Stop feeling like you need to change it, even though it may not live up to your or others ideals.

Realize that your body is neutral, it is social expectations and norms that make you feel the way you do about your body. If there is something you don't like about it, think critically about what it is you don't like and why you don't like it. Maybe changing will make you happier (if for example, you are unhappy about your fitness or health) but also be open to accepting its flaws and recognizing why it is you feel you need to change.

I believe dysphoria occurs when the unrealistic ideal people have for themselves conflicts with their physical reality. Their body is a constant reminder that they aren't what they want to be. The solution is not to mangle your body in a futile attempt to achieve the ideal, but to examine the ideal itself. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with any body; the values we place on our body are a product of the narratives we create about ourselves as part of a society. ","I don't think that would be an interpretation of ''love your body'' ... accepting the way things are can involve a certain amount of resignation and giving up of unrealistic ideals, which may or may not be driven by love, and may or may not be on the path towards love",0

I mumbled something about ancient times where I figure that maybe people didn't know other people of other races all that much. So they couldn't know their intentions. So it's better to stay vigilant?

Then maybe wars where people of different race were demonized as to get more people to fight.

Also, there is probably a need for superiority. To be better than someone is one thing, but if an entire group is discredited, that's being better than thousands!

Finally I thought about the recognition. I think many people feel like they don't belong, so if you can join a club where the colour of your skin - and the hatred of other skin colours - is the only requirement you feel part of something?

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up saying I didn't really know. So I ask you, if you are racist, why so? Where does/did it come from?","The concept of biological race being a question of superiority vs inferiority really began in the early modern period (1500s on) when European nations were busy exploring and conquering the world. Now, don't take this to mean that white people invented mistrust or outright hatred of others; obviously this goes back hundreds of millions or billions of years, deep into evolutionary history, because we see aggression in animals when they encounter creatures they're not familiar with. I mean the concept of ""black"", ""white"", ""Asian"" etc. being ranked as such. Take the Roman Empire for instance. They had a massive slave population on which their economy was largely dependent, but slave vs. free status had absolutely zero to do with race. An Italian could be a slave, a northern European could be a slave, a black guy could be a slave, but at the same time all three of these could be free, even landowning, men, and in fact their status could potentially be changed within a single lifetime. 

In the 1500s-1800s though, things were different. Advanced civilization was concentrated in  specific, largely racially homogeneous zones: Europe (and eventually the Americas) and East Asia being the most prominent. The British, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, etc. had advanced agriculture, urban planning, guns and massive standing armies, ships, etc. while sub-Saharan Africans, Native Americans, southeast Asians, etc. had these things to a much lesser extent or not at all. In other words, these people groups were easy pickings for slave traders. The problem was that the Christian faith brought with it, at least in many situations, a moral compass: a basic desire for human decency, the idea that ""the meek will inherit the earth"", etc. So people needed to justify the exploitation of less politically/technologically advanced people groups. Thus scientific racism was born. If the concept could be promulgated that black and red people were less human than whites, it would stand to reason in most people's minds that maltreatment of them was far less morally repugnant. It's like when people say that insects don't really feel pain because their nervous systems are simple. If darker people have smaller brains, it's OK to push them around and make them work for the white man and his larger brain. ",0

We chatted a bit, she added me on Snapchat, and that was that. When I snapped her the next day and asked what she was up to, things got pretty... ""Suggestive"" pretty fast. Around midnight she was snapping me from the bathtub saying things like ""I'm all alone here"", ""Could use some company"", etc. And when I offered to come join in she said ""Tempting..."", but when I tried to push it a little further and ask where she wanted to meet she just didn't respond.

I'm wondering if she's actually interested in meeting up at all or if she's just a huge tease that enjoys the attention, because the only snap I sent her all day that she didn't respond to was the one asking if she wanted to meet up.

5zeypj,becomeaman,"A different perspective on the ""Alpha"" and how it relates to each of us individually When it comes to being a better man, or a stronger willed man, or whatever aspect of the self you are seeking to develop, the concept of being an ""alpha"" is likely something that you are seeking to achieve. What man wouldn't want to be the leader of the pack?

While I do believe there to be quite a bit of truth to this way of looking at modern society, and our individual roles in it, I don't think we are discussing the whole picture. There is more to the alpha than we might think.

Let's use the wolf pack as an example. Each pack has a hierarchy based typically on things like strength and efficiency, or at least the packs perception thereof. Basically the wolf with the best ability to hunt, protect, and provide takes the position of the alpha or the leader. This is the wolf who most likely has the most valuable genetic makeup, therefor mating only with wolves with good genes, provides a better chance that the species will survive and that future generations will be equally efficient, if not more so. The Omega, or the least skilled wolf, eats last, does not typically mate or impregnate the females, and is not valued as the alpha or even the beta is.

A key concept here is that the alpha is not always the most capable wolf, nor is the omega always the least. The alpha is not definitely going to be the wolf with the most valuable genetic makeup, but there is a good chance that he is. As I said, in the end, it is based solely on the packs perception of him. If a wolf is in fact the most capable and does have the best genetic makeup, but due to some circumstance is seen as weak, or inefficient, another wolf who instinctively believes that he is stronger or more capable, will challenge the alpha for the position. 

Now, lets look at it from a human perspective, only we are going to take a trip back in time. Lets set the clocks to 100,000 B.C 

According to what we know, civilization was not even heard of at this point. The only forms of society were in the small tribes of humans, mostly nomadic hunter-gatherers. These tribes lived similarly to the wolf pack, each with its own hierarchy based on the perception of value, based solely on lthe packs perception of value aka the wolf who's genes are best suited for the survival of offspring, ensuring the survival of the species as a whole. The leader of the tribe is in fact often the most capable, the one is has shown the tribe that he is the most qualified to lead, protect, and provide. Whether or not this is true is irrelevant. However, proving one's abilities is necessary, whether by a true test of strength, or illusion, it does matter, as long as the tribe sees him in a valuable light.

Now for the good stuff. The alpha is not inherently an alpha. He is not born the alpha. While his genetic makeup may make him more suited for the position than others, it is still based on perception, so until he proves himself, he might as well be a beta or an outcast. 

What would happen if for some reason, the alpha were to get separated from his tribe, and were to stumble on other similar tribes in the region? Since he is the alpha or leader of his people, wouldnt he be the alpha of whoever he comes across? Nope. It is all based on perception and now relevativity. Lets say the alpha gets hurt, and he cant properly hunt. He may be required to humble himself when coming across the new tribe in attempt to ask for food. He would no longer be an alpha, but more likely, be the omega. Now lets say he didnt hurt himself, but that he was accepted into the new tribe as just another member. If he doesn't appear as strong or valuable as the new tribes leader, he will not challenge him. If he does believe himself to be more capable and also believed himself to be seen as such, he may or may not challenge the current alpha based on his perception of strength, but maybe not! There is always the chance that his status as alpha was not grounded in fact. Maybe he will live out his days as just another tribesman, abandoning his sense of leadership because the current alpha is stronger.

The point I am making is that being an alpha is not a set trait, nor is it based in reality, it is based on the perception your tribe has of you, only some of which is in your control. What physical and emotional traits that display the alpha male are within your control? Which ones are not? It is true that the men with good genes for strength, intellect, and confidence are more likely to be perceived as an alpha, but it is also true that some alphas are not genetically superior, rather they got lucky, because at some point they came upon circumstances that made others see them as capable, sexually valuable men, with whom mating and following would ensure the survival of the species.

Wherever you go, whenever you meet new people, you have the chance to redesign the expression of your alpha male self. Your body language, behavior, tonality and posture all contribute subconciously to the perception others have of you. However, if you can fake it succesfully, you will become more able to display these traits everytime someone responds positively to your bullshit, until eventually, it is no longer fake.

When it comes to social value and sexual value, fake it till you make it is a literal statement. 

","Totally agree.  The Alpha is most likely someone who has mastered the ability to control and increase his own social values whether with a set of crafty deception, real attributes and valuable skills or more likely a combination of both.  

Bottom line, it is something achievable trough self-improvement and not something set in stone by the genetics your born with.   

Going even further, your genetic code evolves in real time based on your lifestyle, habits, stress etc... its called epigenetic. It is also is proven that you can alter the expression of your gene with your tough patterns....

WMR: Israeli involvement in Chinese Missile Launch
December 6, 2010 

Wayne Madsen Reports (WMR) and U.S. intelligence sources suggest hat China was able to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile off the coast of Los Angeles on November 8 thanks to classified U.S. Navy missile and submarine technology stolen by Israeli intelligence agents.

This  involved in a top secret National Security Agency (NSA) joint project in the 1980s. Israel subsequently passed the data on to the Chinese in return for lucrative defense contracts for Israeli companies with the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The Israeli espionage operation was previously reported by WMR: "" . . . Veterans of the RCA-NSA-Israeli joint SIGINT program code named DINDI report that Israeli engineer spies used the carve out contract with NSA, through RCA, to gain access to NSA and U.S. Navy secrets. 
In an RCA facility in Mount Laurel, NJ, the Israeli engineers had their own secured lab. For three years that DINDI ran, they were walking out with their briefcases loaded with equipment, including scopes. 
When RCA engineers finally gained access to their lab, they found the prints laid out for the Trident missile system. RCA had an ongoing contract to develop the Trident communications suite at the time of the security leak. 
The Israeli engineers on DINDI claimed they were from the Israeli Air Force but months later, an RCA engineer was in New York and he ran into the same Israelis, but they were wearing Israeli Navy uniforms.""","I GO BACK to the insane fact that we have nearly 24 members of Congress with dual citizenship-to where-ISRAEL.

vbmtzw,askAGP,"Being happy as an AGP? Hi everyone, I'm new to this forum. Seeking a little bit of support after getting clarity about my AGP reality. I'm 38, and It's nice to finally feel confident that I understand what is happening after decades of confusion and desperation. But it simultaneously feels like I just got a lifetime prison sentence and I'm staring down another lifetime of loneliness, humiliation, and internal struggle.

A little bit of background, I just started antidepressants a couple of weeks ago, and I'm entering into the 'risky' phase of treatment where people are statistically more likely to commit suicide. It seems clear to me that my feeling and thoughts are not to be trusted right now, and I'm not going to commit suicide, but I'm suffering and seeking support from people who might understand what I'm going through.

Some things have become clear to me recently. I have internalized a hatred for men and I believe that part of my AGP comes from a place of self-loathing in response to the guilt that I feel about being a man in a world dominated by male violence. My worship of the feminine is getting a little out of hand lately and while I don't believe that transitioning will bring me any joy I find myself constantly disappointed that I can never be graceful or beautiful or loved and desired like the beautiful women that are around me frequently. And with what feels like a reduced capacity for heterosexuality due to my AGP nature it's hard to imagine having a fulfilling partnership with a woman. I'm so burnt out on being a man, living like a man, craving femininity in all it's forms. It hurts, and I'm so tired of hurting.

Life is hard enough. It's already challenging to feel like life is worth all of the hardship that comes along with living, all the body and environmental maintenance, the lifetime of labour, facing down a world going to ruin. But adding the isolating experience of being an AGP person without any really good options available to me to ever meet my needs or desires, just feels like yet another crushing con on my pros and cons list for continuing to live.

I don't know what I'm really looking for here. I guess that I'm hoping someone can help me get back my will to live. But I really just want to have a space where I can talk about what's going on for me. My parents, my friends, my therapist, don't understand what it's like, don't have enough available knowledge to really empathize with the AGP people. So with that in mind, thank you for reading my post, and thank you if you have anything to offer in response. I think it's important just to be able to let it out a little bit instead of trying to hold it all in my head.","Loneliness is not that bad. Some of the best orgasms are achieved during long, cold and yet starry nights amidst satin and worlds made of clouds. That's probably better than the vast majority of human presences.

dxgw4sk,greatawakening,"Yes. Child-Blood sacrifices to the evil god: Molech(Lucifer, Satan). I am happy for you. Christianity(man-made-religion) is bullshit, but, Service to Yashua(Jesus's real name) is the ONLY path to Salvation. things are gonna get better for a little while, but, Unfortunately the Dark End of Time must occur. Only Lord Yashua has the power to stop these Servants of Darkness- they are on a mission. As we are. Victory is The Lord Gods, but, it's gonna be an awful mess until His return. Bless you for seeing Yashua's True Light.

EDIT: I forgot. Retired fireman: Mark Taylor prophesied ALL of this ahead of time: Trump elected, Kiddie killers, Tribunals. Search YouTube. and see:                 https://www.sordrescue.com/","Totally agree with you and I have a whole lot more to say on the subject and its importance:

Consider: I maintain that if churches started with the REAL NAME OF THE SAVIOR YAHSHUA and not the ""pagan"" Greek made-up name – (nothing but a transliteration) ""Jesus"" there would be a different spirit in the service.  I am totally fine with NOT using the name of ""jesus"" - the enemy does NOT hate the name ""jesus"" the enemy hates the real name - the name that Yah Almighty purposed the Son to be named"" Yahshua - because Yahshua means Yah's Salvation - ""jesus"" means nothing. It did not exist till 400 years ago because there was no ""j"" in the English language. The nasty anti-Semitic spirit that pervades most churches today which promotes the idea that because of ""blood libel"" God turned his back on the Jews because they did not accept him – because “Jews killed jesus”.   Yahshua said “No one took his life from him – he had power to lay it down and to pick it up” (John 10:18) but churches teach Yah broke covenant with Israel and established a covenant with the ""church"" with ""Christians"" - do you understand that if Yah can break his Word (His Word that said his covenant would stand till the earth passed away - his Word that said he magnified HIS Word above HIS holy name), if HE breaks HIS Word to HIS ""Chosen People"" Israel – then “church” what makes you think HE will keep HIS Word to you?- This idea of ""replacement theology"" is an abomination in the sight of a Holy and Steadfast Creator - Read Romans 11 about how we gentiles as are ""wild olive branches"" grafted into the ""natural olive tree"": Israel - and Paul warns don't get so high and mighty gentiles as Yah broke off some natural branches (this did not negate the covenant to the whole nation of Israel) to graft in us gentiles - so can he break us off. 


You cannot speak the name of Yahshua except by the Holy Spirit. Pagans can curse in the name of ""jesus"" as in ""Jesus H. Christ"" - NO-ONE and I mean NO ONE can speak the name of Yahshua except by the Holy Spirit. Sound becomes light - speak the name ""jesus"" and then speak the name ""Yahshua"" - the atmosphere changes - a discernible difference. Why is that? Some say that ""jesus Hebrew name is Yahshua - NO, Yahshua's name is Hebrew but NOT JUST his Hebrew name. My name on my birth certificate - on my passport is Frances Louise and it does NOT matter if I go to China or Russia or wherever my name stays the same regardless of what they might want to call me. Hebrew names even more so; Hebrew names conferred destiny and described character. Abram did NOT become Abraham until the breath of the Holy Spirit changed his destiny to be called ""Father of many nations"" - Jacob was born ""heal catcher - conniver"" his name changed to ""Israel"" when he wrestled with Yah. Same with Yahshua - His Name means Yah's Salvation or Yah Saves. He was a Hebrew Rabbi - we have a JEWISH MESSIAH:


Think about it, The Messiah Yahshua is the Lamb of Yah, associated with the fulfillment of Passover, "" There is no such thing as ""good friday"" unless you worship Dagon the Phillistine ""fish god"" (1 Sam. 5) and Yahshua had told the Pharisees a wicked generation seeks after a sign and none would be given except the sign of Jonas (Jonah) ""as Jonah was three days and three NIGHTS in the belly of the whale, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the earth"") No way is a crucifixion on friday and resurrection SUNday morning. Yahshua as the Passover Lamb ""slain before the foundation of the world"" was crucified Wed and rose after sunset Saturday AFTER the Sabbath.   Jesus"" is associated with ""Easter"" which is Ishtar the Babylonian fertility goddess that changed birds into egg laying rabbits – that had  her pagan priests impregnate virgins and then sacrifice the babies and dye eggs in the blood of the sacrificed babies - Yahshua is associated with the LORDS FEAST of Tabernacles because he struck a tent in human flesh - The Word made flesh and dwelt among us - which means the Messiah was born in Sept. - ""Jesus"" is associated with ""ChristMAS"" which is the pagan time of the winter solstice - (Scripture tells us in Jer10:1-4 cutting and decking trees is a PAGAN practice – fact is the tree is a phallic symbol - the ""ornaments"" on it are ""the balls (testicles) of Egyptian SUN god Ra"" Jeremiah also prophesied that gentiles would come to the Jews and say “we have inherited lies from our fathers. Jer. 16:19 ). The Puritans would have nothing to do with ""ChristMAS trees"" - 


It does not surprise me one bit that the church that will not even utter the True Name of the Savior is under a DIFFERENT SPIRIT - YES, IT IS STRANGE FIRE. And if you think it doesn't matter: Prov. 30:4 asks: ""what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?"" - It matters. The Father is gracious and long suffering when people don't know any different. He looks at the heart. BUT when they have been taught and persist in speaking another name - then we have a spirit of rebellion, stubbornness and it is as witchcraft. Ask yourself, why would you want to persist in calling your Redeemer by a different name. The Bride should at-least know the Grooms name! Makes me really wonder about this scripture:  ""Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity."" Matt7:22-23. Sort of like with the sons of Sceva who thought they could command devils by the ""name that Paul Preaches"" and the devils tore them apart for they knew they did not know or have the authority to use the Name. (Acts 19).
There is so much about the importance of The Name - BUT that name is not, nor ever has, nor ever will be ""Jesus"" and that is why you have churches with Naked Cowboys and ""married Christian rock stars saying they are gay”. It’s under a ""different spirit"" it is STRANGE FIRE. And ""Satan can NOT cast out Satan"" The ""Lion of the Tribe of Judah"" is not nor never has been nor ever will be named ""Jesus"" - Names in Hebrew are more than sounds - they convey function. That is why Yah Almighty purposed HIS Son to be called YAHUSHUA - the name is the function - it means ""Yah's Salvation"".
Now it is true people have been saved, delivered and healed using the name ""Jesus"" - that is only because the Messiah looks at the heart - knows your intention - but the fact is The Lion of the Tribe of Judah is YAHUSHUA -


So much of scripture speaks of the importance of ""The Name"" so of course Satan would corrupt its meaning. Maybe one of the reasons there is such a spirit of rebellion against using the true name of the Messiah might be traced to the fact EVERY early church father was anti-Semitic - this should be required viewing for every church: I maintain that if these churches started with the REAL NAME OF THE SAVIOR YAHSHUA and not the ""pagan"" Greek made-up name - nothing but a transliteration ""Jesus"" there would be a different spirit in the service. At the 500th anniversary Protestant Reformation maybe its time to ""complete the reformation and that starts with acknowledging who our savior is and why its important to honor the name and character and integrity of the Messiah and purge out of our worship EVERY PAGAN influence: this should be required viewing for every church: www.letthelionroar.com

peroy5,Intactivists,"How to discuss the negative impact of MGM on women? 37F intactivist here looking for perspective. I have been anti-circumcision since I was 19. I had a LiveJournal friend who was active with NOCIRC (now Genital Autonomy America.) I read the information he posted and immediately realized that if it was an unnecessary procedure and any number of men, even if they were a tiny minority, wished that it hadn’t been done to them, then RIC was obviously wrong. It was just that simple and obvious in my mind. I was pretty naive then, full of optimism about the Internet, and figured that as soon as this information was widely disseminated the practice would go away, whether by rapidly falling out of favor or being banned everywhere. I have always been childfree, so I figured I would never have to make the decision myself, and the whole thing was shoved to the back of my mind. 

Fast forward to about three years ago. The subject came to my attention again through a post about the Bloodstained Men. I was alarmed to realize that not only was this debate raging harder than ever, there had even been some lost progress such as the most recent AAP statement on circumcision. I dug deeper and I found [Sex As Nature Intended It](http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/).

As I read every word on the site, lightbulbs and alarm bells started going off in my head. I started to make connections that had never occurred to me. I got mad, then I got sad, then I became absolutely livid to realize how deeply my life as a US-born woman was negatively impacted by MGM.

I was married for nine years to a good man who I still respect as a person. He had been circumcised as a baby and expressed to me early on that he wished it had been his choice. He actually had even started restoring before we got together, but stopped because he was a little freaked out by the process and I said it didn’t matter to me, because I didn’t think it did. The sex in our relationship dropped off very quickly and there was a huge mismatch - meaning I wanted to do it once a day and he was okay with never, so we “compromised” with a few times a year. I’m not going to go into unnecessarily graphic detail, but I realized that many if not all of his sexual issues could be explained by the fact that he’d been circumcised. Ultimately it wasn’t even the lack of sex that ended our relationship but his poor self esteem because of it that I tried for years to fix and just couldn’t. For some reason we never made the connection when we were together - I think he had just deeply internalized the problem and I was just ignorant. 

This next part is kind of embarrassing. My next partner was intact, and it was the first time I’d had intact sex. For the first time ever sex felt as magical as I had always wanted it to feel and thought it should. Sparks flew, oxytocin shot to new highs, and, long story short, I stayed with that guy about four years longer than I should have because I thought the fact that sex felt so much better with him despite the fact that he barely moved in bed meant that we had some sort of magical connection. I really thought that, and I even told a few friends as much. I have since had the opportunity to confirm that we did not have some sort of magical connection; he simply had his entire penis to work with. 

I used to think it was normal for me to get a mild vaginal infection every time I had sex with a new partner. I was used to that; it usually lasted for a week or two and then my chemistry would adjust to theirs or whatever. My first intact partner was also the first one who didn’t give me an infection, and again I attributed that to how our bodies were so finely tuned to each other. Nope, that was just his foreskin, too. 

In a fantastically ironic twist, I actually got myself “circumcised” (labiaplasty that included clitoral hood reduction as well as reduction of my labia minora), not for aesthetic reasons but because I thought it was my “excessive” (actually normal) vulval skin that was preventing me from achieving clitoral stimulation during intercourse, when it was actually my ex-husband’s surgically modified penis that could no longer stimulate me in the right place.

I could honestly write a book about the butterfly effect of negative consequences that I believe MGM has had on my own life, but I am already worried I’ve shared too much because I am deeply concerned about triggering any actual, direct victims who are already all too aware of what was taken from them, and who have clearly suffered from this a great deal more than I have. But that concern brings me to my point and my question…

Unfortunately we know that most people will never care about a cause enough to make serious sacrifices of time, money, reputation, etc. unless they feel directly affected by it. I could have picked up the banner of genital integrity fifteen years earlier the moment I heard about the cause, but I didn’t. I’m sorry I wasn’t here earlier, but I’m here now, and I want to bring other woman to our side through whatever means possible.

How can I publicly discuss the harm that circumcised penises can cause to women without causing further pain to male victims who are already struggling? In the past my intactivism was based in local organizing, discussions on my personal social media, and private discussions with every one of my female friends. I no longer live in a country that performs RIC, so now I’m here on Reddit and not quite sure how to proceed with so many potential eyes on my words.

I do think it’s crucial to share this information with other women. I don’t know if it’s good to include my personal experience when I discuss it or if subjective experiences are too easily dismissed. Please tell me if what I’ve shared above is too much information or not enough. I feel absolutely sick over the idea of making someone who is struggling feel even worse about his body. On the other hand, I kind of think that cut men who mock natural penises could use a bit of a blow to their egos since there’s a good chance it’s never even occurred to them a woman might prefer a “turtleneck.” Am I wrong for thinking this way? Is it counterproductive? Honestly, I’m not really expecting to get through to cut men who are in denial. I’m hoping that what I say might plant the seed of doubt in the minds of women, get them to start connecting the dots and hopefully come to the conclusion that if there’s even a small chance that the sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction they’ve experienced could be connected to male circumcision, they’ll decide to go the safe route and just skip it for their sons.

Any insight or feedback from cut men or anyone at all who has experience talking about this topic will be well-received and very much appreciated.",i think it's very helpful to include your personal experience.,0

dd4pcoi,metacanada,"&gt; Bend over and bite down on the pillow the liberals are about to fuck us hard.

I'm a liberal. But if anything comes out of this, it's that **there are extremists on both sides and it's up to us Canadians to fight it**.  If what is ""alleged"" about Alexandre Bissonnette is true, it's possible he may have committed these murders out of his hatred of Muslims (but let's let the authorities investigate this).

As of today, if my understanding is correct, this is the greatest act of terror on Canadian soil with the most deaths and most injured.  However, I will not gloat and say ""see, it's not a Muslim, I told you so,"" because it's very well possible that an even greater act of terror can be committed by a radical Islamist on another day in the future.  Then the tables will turn and you'll be telling liberals like me ""I told you so.""

What I ask of the people in this forum is that you do your part to fight extremists on the far right - to prevent them from committing a similar act on Canadian soil.  **We need to fight extremists on both sides - on all sides.**  I know I share different beliefs than many of you, especially when it comes to immigration, but I think all of you reading this aren't out to commit murder on other Canadians, even if you have different beliefs than those Canadians.

If you can do your part to prevent another atrocity like this by the next ""Alexandre Bissonnette,"" whoever he or she may be,  you'll have made Canada a better place to live.  And as a liberal who does believe in helping refugees in dire need (even though you may disagree with me on this point), I will keep up the pressure on our government to properly vet refugees from Muslim countries, to use the highest standards of vetting, and to properly settle these refugees in supporting and loving communities so that we can lower the risk as much as possible of any of these refugees or their children becoming radical Islamic extremists in the future.

Edit: My message isn't about gun control.
",Dude what? The liberals have already set the stage for changes to the firearms act and this is the the chance for public approval. They're stacking the firearms advisory committee with anti gun groups. The public safety minister told every gun owner to go get fucked when the RCMP prohibited the butler creek magazines for the 10/22. The liberals are going to push for some very strict laws and will use misinformation and feels to make that happen.,0

cnh1zed,fPUA,"Hey, saw your post in r/askseddit and I really like the responses there. I think there's some gold in their advice and in the advice posted here.

Here's something I haven't seen anyone address and I understand that the race card can seem like a copout. But, as a fellow black female who's lived in several places with varying racial diversity, I have to ask: Do you live in a predominantly white area? Is it racially diverse? Or is it a predominantly black area? None of the above? I ask because in the US (and abroad) black women are usually made to feel like the least desirable. I know for myself, it took A LOT of self-coaching to teach myself that I'm beautiful despite mainstream beauty standards.
You call yourself ""severely ugly"" -- according to what scale? Sure, the weight is a number, easily measurable and like many have stated here, it's a relatively easy fix. But, how are you measuring your beauty? When was the first time you really felt ""ugly"" and when was the first time you ever felt desired? I ask these questions because part of the confidence that comes in approaching men is believing that you're worthy of being desired. If your belief that you're ""severely ugly"" is deeply rooted in something you heard or felt as a child, then it's gonna take some coaching to move you out of that mindset.

To answer the questions in your original post: 
 
1. You've heard this a lot but: Get to working out. It can be at the gym, join a dance class, the playground. Whatever. Aim to be rigorously active for an our every day to start. You can google and youtube body-weight exercises if you don't have access to a gym. You can do those in your bedroom. Establish a goal weight, find a fun routine, vary it from time to time but *stick with it.*

2. Someone else mentioned hobbies and group activities. I can't stress this enough. Join group activities in your area. NOT with the goal of finding a boyfriend, but with the goal of becoming more comfortable with meeting and approaching strangers. To start and maintain interesting conversations on both mundane and deep topics. Practice with the people you meet there. What works? What keeps someone riveted and when do people start to look around the room and look disinterested? This gives you a wider base of knowledge of social cues for when you feel comfy enough to approach men you're interested in.

3. Don't take rejection personally. This is hard, but easier than most will have you think. If you're going to go out there and meet people and be adventurous, you have to be prepared to not be liked. Some people just won't like you. Your response shouldn't be to then criticize yourself. Let it roll off your back and start anew elsewhere. Obviously, if many people are reacting negatively to you then you should always look to improve any turn-offs you may be projecting.

4. To repeat what someone on Seddit mentioned: Keep a positive tone during conversation. If someone brings up the weather and it's raining and you HATE rain, you can casually mention that you're not into rain but you love how badass the city looks after it rains. Maybe not the best example, but at least you won't drone on about how the rain gets you down. Guys don't like a negative nancy.

I hope this and all the other responses have been helpful. Self-improvement is a long journey but it doesn't always have to be lonely. Best of luck to you and if you have any follow up Q or if I can offer any further help, PMs are welcome.

No tl;dr.",The fact that call myself severely ugly is because In my family I was never the pretty one. I have a light skinned sister who was always referred to as the pretty one and there I am in the corner the dark skinned ugly one. It also doesn't help that in the black community that lighter skin is revered while dark skin is just starting to be tolerated,0

http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf

But maybe they didn't have European people and their descendants in mind when they declared it.

All it really does is illustrate the powerlessness and hypocrisy of the UN, and of anyone who supports indigenous people like the native Tibetans, but not the native Germans, or Swedes.","The mere fact that the marxist-left have mass compassion for the genocide of Tibet due to extreme immigration of Chinese into Tibet and the systematic oppression that is happening to Tibetans, for years this has favoured mass leftist compassion, but suddenly when applied to white native people many of the malevolent and destructive marxists of the left just pretend to not know what you're talking about. Because they're a bunch of soul-less hypocites and dishonest con-men who are only interested in outright genociding(murdering) us in the name of ""demo""-cracy just, because Jewish institutions have brainwashed them for years into supporting their own extinction.

7btadj,CCJ2,"International Rainy? Hi ccj2. I do not live in China, I live in the UK, but I like lurking here and find the memes funny (not sure if I'm allowed to post here). I am also a bit of an alcoholic like a lot of you seem to be.

My question is: is there such thing as an ""International Rainy?"" Or is there a general term for a young Chinese girl studying abroad? I have been friends with her for a while and she recently asked me to teach her to ice skate (I can't ice skate but I'm not going to tell her until I get her on the ice).

She is from a wealthy background, but she seems quite traditional. She complains a lot about English people/culture and how all English men get ugly by age 40. She likes China and the CCP. Her style is very non-westernized (lots of white makeup, weird Chinese-girl style of dress). She has been here for 3 years, writing assignments in English, but she cannot write or speak a full sentence of unbroken English. She only goes to Chinese restaurants and hates British food. I am her only non-chinese friend but she said all of her boyfriends so far have been white. Recently she got angry at me when I texted her a funny picture and asked ""what do you want from me?!"", even though she already asked me on a date. I told her I like her and think she's cute, and she's been a bit cold ever since.

Is this a type of ""Rainy"" or a type of Chinese girl that has her own category? And if so, can anyone give me advice? I would be very grateful. I like her but a lot gets lost in translation, language and cultural

TLDR: What's the name for Chinese girls studying abroad who cause young Western men a lot of confusion? Can you give me any advice about this type of girl?",If you tell her 你好 she'll definitely take her pants off.,1

2xck3v,asktrp,"Struggeling between setting standards and not acting needy. Situation:
I fly to china this we and my LTR is staying in Homecountryland.

Yesterday she told me she will go to a friend of hers ( an orbiter she has since kindergarden ) and will do drugs.
I'm sure nothing happend between them in past, I cant talk for the future, but he's just so nice, no sexual vibe. I wouldn't bother myself with this topic, as this one friend is a good guy and an emotional tampon for her. Which is an important person. 

What bothers me is the feeling to set a standard:
 - I would like to be asked if I'm ok with her going to somebody else doing drugs.
 - He is a man, and I would never tollerate this if she would do this with another guy.
 - I'm ok with drugs, I do them myself and I do them with her, but drugs are things that alter your perception and might have this ""alcohol"" effect where you might do silly things you'll regret. And I will not excuse anything because of drugs. It's ok and important to have fun, but if it gets to the point where you lose control, you're just lost your priorities and let ""other forces"" control your life. I do would dump her if it comes to this point. Nothing bothers me more than people self pittying theyr lack of control. 

Back to the situation: 
The moment she told me that she mets her friend and that they will do drugs.
I wen't compleatly uninterested and acted as if she would not be here.
That drove her crazy.
After about half an hour I said I want a blojob and got one of the best I've ever recieved.
But I did not state anything about the situation and fell asleep quite after.

Now to my question.
So How do I tell her this?
I don't want to sound needy or controlling.
But I'm neither willing to just accept this situation and not express how I wan't to be treated. Because it allready feld kinda unrespectfull how she did it, by not asking me if I'm ok with that. 
But I want my standards are to be respected, because otherwise I don't see how I will find her interesting anymore. I could possibly only image keeping her as a fuck buddy.","It is entirely acceptable for you to established boundaries for your relationship.

They had broken up over two years ago since he drunkenly kissed someone else at a party and she has had massive trust issues because of this. She says she's going to guilt-trip him if he replies and also make his current girlfriend insecure. Her logic is that women should not date men who they know have been unfaithful to other women in the past and that women owe each other at least that much. 

I told her she's being entitled and behaving like a downright asshole since I don't think her inability to move on is the other woman's problem. She disagreed and we had a huge argument.

4f5g0e,RedPillWives,"How should I behave in this situation? How old are you and how familiar are you with RPW?

I am 29 and have been reading on and off on your old webpage. Just found this new webpage now. 

What is your relationship status?

Married for 4 1/2 years.

What is the problem? (Don’t badmouth your SO!)

We have 3 very young children and are in a lot of debt. We have both dreamed of and idealized this perfect fantasy of a traditional family but things are not going very well. I currently stay at home and earn no income and feel desperate about our financial situation. I do very much want to stay at home and focus on being a wife and mother, but I am so afraid of what could happen to us if things don't get better soon financially. I don't want to go to work, but I believe it would help get us out of our troubles, or even attempt some form of at-home business. My husband absolutely disagrees - he wants to continue with our current lifestyle, despite the fact that we cannot afford it and keep going deeper into debt, and does not want to talk much with me about our problems aside from casually saying that he will handle it, he will figure out something, and so on. I feel that I cannot get through to him how serious the situation is. He is able to get jobs where he makes good money, but he loses jobs all the time and I don't understand why. He typically gets a new job straightaway but I'm confused by this pattern. He also does not believe in using any kind of charity, social assistance, food bank, or anything like that. He is unhappy when I suggest it. 

I can see that he is not happy generally anymore. He used to be laid-back and very alpha in the way RP describes, naturally without effort, and very masculine and calm, but recently I can see he is unhappy, very irritable, and doesn't have much energy.

What should I do and what is the best way for me to behave in this situation? Do I go against his wishes so I can get money for our family? Or do I try to behave in a way that would motivate him to be able to overcome our problems? In either case how would I go about it? How do I make him happy again?

How have you contributed to the problem?

I get stressed out easily and I am not good at handling stress. I look to my husband for reassurance way too much and I know that I annoy him with this but can't stop doing it. I know that I increase his stress with all of this, rather than easing his stress as a wife should. I do everything a traditional woman should on the ""outside"" while not really feeling it on the inside, I go through the motions but don't really feel it anymore, and I am sure that it shows. Over the past few months I have been feeling a resentment towards him for not supporting our family, not being a good leader, and I didn't feel this way before. I used to feel happy and passionate about everything. I criticize him, sometimes out loud and sometimes just in my head. I have been thinking what's best for the children and I, and haven't been concerned with his happiness or well-being at all.

How long has this been an issue?

We started going into debt 2 1/2 years ago, but it has really spiralled out of control in the last year. 

What have you done to resolve this problem?

I have done my best to become super frugal. I work hard day and night doing everything I can to save money. Cook from scratch, make our own cleaning/hygiene/baby products, I truly work very very hard at all of it. Tried to start a garden but there just isn't enough time in the day. 

How long have you been together?

6 years total, 4 1/2 married. 

Is your relationship long-distance?

No. 

Do you have an active bedroom life?

Yes, although I have become less happy about it over the past few months, though I have not expressed my feelings. I used to always feel very passionate and sexual, but lately I feel like my sex drive has diminished. I never refuse him but I don't feel that same natural passion very much anymore.

6fs41l,fPUA,How to tell if emotional hook point signs are genuine? ,"You have to develop your ability to get to know someone. It will always be a useful skill in any avenue of life both inside and outside of seduction. The most illustrating observation is how people spend their time. Someone might deliver a whole notion about lifelong commitment but if they're not consistent with this attitude then there's not a lot to substantiate their words. So essentially, look at actions, not words.

If you asked a doctor about their profession, they would probably be able to tell you a lot of things. Where they went to learn, their favorite course, stories about different studies, where they buy the lab jackets, what sort of practice they're hoping to work for, etc etc.

So, someone who wasn't a doctor probably wouldn't be able to field any believable answers to those questions. They wouldn't have a lab jacket or a degree or anything like that. Considering someone and their emotions usually has the same extent of verisimilitude. An authentic connection between two people will generally have evidence (emotional and otherwise), you just have to know how to identify and interpret it.

Though at the end of the day, there will never be any guarantee that someone will want to be with you even and especially if they themselves said or thought so. Part of being an adult is judiciously making decisions, and being wrong about them is only ever an opportunity to improve.",0

As everyone has already pointed out, the intersex community has fought hard against medical genital correction specifically in regards to their children.

And yes, this is forced, because a child cannot consent to this operation. It would be a parent and a doctor who would decide this surgery. A child isn't developmentally able to consent. Same goes for any other medical procedure, but often the parents overrule for the best interest of the child (to keep them healthy).

With surgery to correct intersex organs, this is an aesthetic procedure and not for the health of the child. The only exception would be if their genital development posed a risk to their health, like a urethra blockage or something.

As far as mental health and well-being goes, genital correction (or, medical genital mutilation) is not the best method for this. That would be like giving an anorexic liposuction to ""benefit their mental health"". It might cause them brief satisfaction, but if this child really had a mental illness relating to their body, it would not cure the underlying issue of gender dysphoria. Detransitioners are great to talk to about this.","I'm not talking about genital ""correction"", I'm talking about hormone therapy. I'm opposed to genital surgery on children.

ovyecr,Intactivists,"A discussion on intactavist tactics What tactics do you find useful? What methods actually change minds? How can we weed out counter productive tactics in favor of more effective?

I just came from reading a Facebook comment section about circumcision. It was a real shit storm. I follow brother K and BSM on Facebook so I see when they post about someone soon to circumcise their son, or already have done it. And when the person's identity and post is shared, there are a ton of intactavist commenting. Some people just spamming with intactavist pictures. And others devolve into insults and inflammatory statements.

I understand the emotion behind the comments, and they are all valid feelings to people saying circumcision is ""no big deal"" or ""normal"". But I think people are more likely to ""double down"" and not change their mind if they feel attacked. It doesn't even need to be an attack, if they feel like they are attacked then there is no changing that mind.

In terms of Internet comments, I think fewer comments is more effective, especially if it's on some random strangers post. No copy and paste comments, and no endless memes.

Do you disagree? Is there a way to change the tactics of intactavist as a whole?","I'll share a tactic that I think is easy and effective.

I have bumper stickers from TLC and your whole baby.

On one of my cars it has two stickers, ""bring home your whole baby, say no to circumcision"" and ""boys are born perfect too Your whole baby.org""

And the other car has two stickers, ""10 out of 10 babies oppose circumcision"" and ""forced genital cutting of unethical""

It's entertaining to watch people in the rear view mirror at drive thrus and signal lights. People will point it out and take pictures sometimes.

Because of my bumper stickers I've had good discussions with my sister, who unfortunately circumcised her sons. They were circumcised before I learned of the damage of my own circumcision and got into intactavism. 

Once she was in a car with a friend and they were following me in my car. After we met at the destination, I overheard her talking to her friend about how circumcision is wrong and not necessary. Now, I don't think she is an active intactavist, but when the subject is brought up I think she will say that it is wrong and uneccessary. I don't think there would be the same results if she was accused and attacked. And she is a doula, so although her own sons were not spared, she may be about to save others.",0

I'm not gonna sit here and cite millions of sources when you can discover them yourself with a few clicks on your keyboard and mouse or go your university's library or a bookstore or something.

I don't really have a side on the modern day Israel thing, but when it comes to history I do have a side, and that is to understand the objective truth, denying the holocaust is just delusional and plain wrong. It shouldn't be up to provide evidence of the holocaust happening, it should be up to you to prove that it didn't.

The entirety of reputable Historians on the era agree that the genocide did occur and that the number of dead Jews floats around 6 million. It's easy to say that they are all in on the conspiracy or some other cop-out excuse, but if there WERE some actual serious discrepancies with the absolute mountains of data and evidence... don't you think there would be some serious fucking debates going on within the historical community?

This is you trying to convince yourself, and delude yourself into thinking somehow only I deny the holocaust, even though multiple heads of state also know it's a fraud, and plenty of credible historians and forensic scientists who did their research say it....oh that's right if you disagree with the holo-dogma you magically lose your credibility because the jewish credibility overlords say so.

I think this also creates a view that if you can’t give your partner an orgasm just from PiV sex, your not masculine, you’re small or bad at sex. So some men will shy away from other methods as this is seen as this is seen as admission of these things.

I think we need to start taking a completely different approach to sex, because the idea that you can just go at it and perfectly read your partners body language to give them what they want, even more so since women can feel expected to fake an orgasm to please there partner, and some men feel they need to repress their emotions and be near silent during sex.

If instead we had a more open view towards sex and talked about it, what we enjoy, what we don’t, what compromises we can make. It’s obvious that the things both sexes most enjoy are not the same thing, and so that discourse is required because if a guy feels he’s required to take charge, and doesn’t actually know what it is their partner enjoys (more so in the case of a hookup), they will just do what feels good to them.

I genuinely don’t know how a male view would be seen on here, and I obviously want you to know I’m supportive of this and almost all other views on here. I just thought this might add to the discussion because this view point definitely impacts both sexes view towards sex.","I really appreciate your input and I know the majority of the sub would too.

I was doing fine for a while, but I'm lonely now. I feel like I do nothing but go to work to get away from sitting at home and then go home to get away from being at work. Repeat ad nauseum for the last year. I want to share things with my person again. Good things, bad things, fun things, mundane things. I want to to talk about our days, complain about that dumb thing that happened at work, and fall asleep on the couch with empty ice cream containers on the table. I want to binge re-watch all of the Marvel movies. I want to go to fun events like MAGFest again (maybe not this upcoming January...we'll see.) I want to adopt a dog or two at some point. Yeah, I could do all of these things by myself but they would be so much better with the right person. Tell me the things you don't want to do alone?

I'll be 35 in less than a week. That's a milestone I guess. I don't really pay much attention to birthdays anymore but my mom usually calls and reminds me. So I've got that going for me!

I think I'm a pretty boring person but I kind of like that. I am very much an introvert and that has made relationships with extroverts very difficult in the past. I deal with pretty bad social anxieties. I don't like being out in big groups of people very often, so don't expect that kind of thing a lot.

415 DL  
365x1 Squat  
180x5 BP  

**Weekly Failures:**   
Big one this week. What I would call a ""serious event"" ongoing.   

Work from home, nights. Was taking a break, watching some Dr. Anabolic videos about steroid usage (Reinforcing my decision to never turn to anabolics), watching some All-22 tape on the Rams, and was looking at fun new positions to try with the wifey on my phone.  

Wife wakes up, sneaks downstairs (I can absolutely hear her when she's walking normally, so clearly was trying to 'catch' me), sticks her head into my office and sees what I'm doing. Assumes I'm watching porn.   

Demands to see phone, see video I'm watching, who is she, how much are you paying for it, etc etc etc. Hamster wheel at light speed. I set a boundary 6-8 months ago about my phone. Hard. No. Every time she has the opportunity to get on my phone she goes full Sherlock and we end up with monster nonsense about some bullshit memes I send friends or some nonsense that gets discussed in a group chat.   

I'll leave out the bullshit here but basically she's upstairs crying in our bedroom and watching porn on her phone as ""revenge"". Did some beta bullshit where I snatched her phone from her hands when she started doing it, but realized how retarded I was being and basically backed off. She's either pregnant or about to have her period, emotions and hormones are in full flight. We've been fucking like rabbits the last month, with lots of aforementioned new positions being enjoyable for both of us and increased dominance in the bedroom being responded to extremely positively. Now I'm getting the riot act about her joining Tinder, cheating on me, wants a divorce, never going to have sex with me again... the usual ""end of the world"" nonsense she gets up to when her emotions are in total control.   

Disappointed in myself. Basic bitch nonsense looking at that shit on my phone, and my ""fight or flight"" reaction was still pretty shit-tier. I've been successful with monk mode and nofap thus far, no PMO beyond what I would call ""inspiration"" for positions to try. Fought the urge to DEER with her and shut down pretty hard with broken record. She continually escalated, as expected, to try to get me to cave.  

When she gets going, man. It's like a train with no brakes. I just STFU'd and calmly stared her down. Nothing else to really say. I doubt she's done at this point. Likely will end up with her leaving within the next 90 minutes.   

Continuing to escalate now to ""If I have another miscarriage because of the stress then it's 100% on you"" (I was told I was responsible for 'killing our child' after her first miscarriage at 4 weeks)  

Difficult. I want to cave, to take her hand and to tell her I'm sorry, that she's right and I'm a shitty man, show her what I was looking at, basically give in to her every demand. Why the everloving fuck do I want that?

I've said it before and I'll say it again. I was raised to be a fucking autist with women. Stupid decisions beget stupid arguments beget my Wife not knowing what the fuck is going on and losing her mind.   

**Body:**  
PR'd squat and bench last week. Coaching is helping a ton. 365 flew up easily, and benched 180x5 on a camber bar. Doing a powerlifting meet at the end of March. Hoping for a 400ish squat, 225ish bench, and 450ish DL. We'll see.   

Not much to say here. Been smashing 5/3/1 BBB accessories hard and eating like a whale. Definitely adding body fat, but adding visible muscle mass as well. Up to 178-180lbs. Will compete at 181 so I need to back off the eating to make my competition cut realistic.  

Wife had made comments about how I was visibily getting more body fat. Clearly prefers me lean, which is understandable, but bulk life is what it is.

**Career:**  
Volunteered to take on a big project that no one else wants to do. Pain point for the company and I've thrown my mind at it wholeheartedly. A lot of opportunity to add value and demonstrate additional value in the run-up to my salary negotiation in March. I *must* keep grinding here if I want to achieve my goals.   


**Mind:**  
Almost complete with MMSLP. Humorous, somewhat, in that implementing much of the reading has been so successful and now I got myself into this stupid situation.

Lost my Kindle Paperwhite, somehow. Think I left it at the gym, maybe? Angry. Reading on my Kindle Fire instead, but is much shittier in terms of battery life and overall experience. I'll consider it punishment for not keeping track of my possessions.   

Still sober. Still intend on being sober. The little addiction goblin on my shoulder has mostly shut up. I can honestly say I haven't had a problem dismissing the thoughts of seeking out weed again, which is nice. Early days, yet. I've gone 30 days before. Typically start to fall apart after 6 months to a year when complacency sets in. Some idle thoughts floating around about ""Well maybe just a little bit on vacation, or when she and the kid are gone for a weekend..."" Typical addict thoughts that are a shortcut to ruining any discipline or momentum I've built thus far.  

Daily reflections of conscience have really continued to help. Dedicating 5-10 minutes to a mental review of my day every time I sleep.

cgqtg5i,MensRights,"Alright: If the situation is that he cannot properly defend himself against any outside move, then I would consider this situation an indecent assault (in its legal sense). And he is not cheating. It is missing the violent part for rape.
The point in this case is, that he did not actively choose to enter any sexual activity (which would make this cheating) but rather the girl uses a situation in which the boy (a) has an impaired judgment and (b) has no longer the physical ability to defend himself. It is the equivalent of a girl getting raped by a strong man, and there we have the ""don't teach women how to minimize the risk of rape, teach the men not to rape"".
When it comes to cheating, I consider the circumstances of the ""incident"". If my girlfriend goes out and has sex with another guy while being sober, this is cheating and a reason to dump her the moment I learn about it. I consider that scenario highly offensive, since there is obviously a problem and she does not respect me enough to talk about it openly. If she was drunk or otherwise voluntarily intoxicated, I can overlook one incident. But it is very likely that this situation happens again (the next night out is just a week away), and for my own well-being I cannot tolerate a second ""drunk mistake"". If there were special circumstances (and with special I mean tampered drinks or black-out drunk) I would not consider it cheating, since she did not actively choose to cheat in any way. ","&gt; It is missing the violent part for rape.

In USA (and I assume many other nations), violence need not occur for a sex act to be classified as rape. Coercion, threat, and incapacitation are also viable arguments for considering the act to be nonconsensual and therefore rape. 

I'd say it's very good that rape law includes such situations, as long as we're careful to draw the lines at reasonable places when dealing with the gray areas of voluntary intoxication or voluntary agreement to quid pro quo sex when reasonable alternatives exist. 

Basically, if you made a statement of non-consent, or were unable to do so, then it's rape. 

It ought to be pretty simple...but in the real world, coy games, buyer's remorse, and evasion of responsibility muddy the waters significantly. ",0

crb2ngj,masculism,"those ""fact sheets"" are media tools, rather than actual metrics of their organization that are submitted for funding. when service providers see a client for something (such as DV support), they are required to record it and then submit it to the funding bodies (such as state, federal government, or private grant-providers) each financial cycle (which can be by fiscal year, quarter, month, depends on the funder). this is the way that funding organizations measure demand for services, and the distribution of funds for future planning. I agree that there's a lot of old, unnecessarily gendered wording floating around on pages like that (RAINN), but to act like an organization is ""erasing"" survivors, when it can claim those survivors as clients (in order to keep existing funding or to qualify for new funding based on demographics served), is kind of illogical.

enkhk6,askseddit,"24M Late bloomer that finally has his first girlfriend...and more questions/concerns than ever. I am a fairly typical 'late bloomer' story. I am pretty hard on myself for my lack of experience, but I believe I'm in a somewhat common circumstance for this generation. In high school previous, I just had a few crushes and so on. Never had my first kiss. In my 4 years of college, I 'talked' to a lot of different girls, and made out with and ""felt up"" a few at parties, etc. No real sexual experience, but I did date a girl for a few months in something semi-committed. Looking back, it was a same anxiety about intimacy that did hold me back to some degree.

In the year and a half since college ended, my life has turned around a lot. I have a professional career that is going very well (although that is leading to another feeling of being overwhelmed :/ ) . I have my own apartment, my own car, and am pretty independent. Since then, I have done a lot more dating - although usually in the form of 1/2/3/4 dates with limited physical touch and no labels.

Recently, I have become involved with a girl named Alexa, who is 23. We basically met through a mutual friend. We have been dating 2 months now, and we recently had the boyfriend - girlfriend talk. She is a cute girl with a good job as a nurse. Most of all, I'm really excited about her values - she is very sweet, and seemingly comes from an amazing family.

However, I've been feeling really blue in the stomach about some of it. Here are some of my emotions:

* Attachment and alone time. I have a tiny apartment - less than 400 square feet. She has been coming over and sleeping over. Usually this entails coming over around 7PM, and leaving around 11 or 12 in the morning. Honestly, I feel desperately ready for some space when she leaves near the end of it. Also, I'm not sure *how* attached to her I feel. When we almost broke up (my silliness), I felt completely and utterly crushed for two days - almost sick. But when I'm with her, it's more of a peaceful feeling. Not drunk in love, or anything like that.
* Commitment. It's super weird for me, now that I have someone I'm accountable to. I can't just ignore a text from her for an entire evening. I have to make an effort to see her multiple times a week. I can't just totally disappear. I'm still crazy attracted to other women, but it feels like I can't quite fantasize to the same way
* Sex. It has been really hard so far. I am working to please he - we've been doing other 'stuff'. I have not yet been able to properly have sex wearing a condom, after a few tries. I believe I have a fairly large penis, and condoms are really tight.This has been humiliating. I also get horrible blue balls when we hold hands, or even make out. I feel like this has made me feel terrible about myself, when it should be something that makes me feel good. She's been ridiculously understanding about it, but I feel like it can't go on longer. I have considered talking to a doctor.
* Telling my family. For whatever reason, I have a really tough time telling my parents I'm seeing someone. They are the 'teasing' type. Still, I know they'd be very happy to hear.

I really believe a lot of this is in my head. This will be a pivotal relationship - whether or not it's with her, I believe it will have a big impact on my self esteem.

I want to curl up in a ball. It's so much out of my comfort zone right now. I don't want to let this girl down.

Can anybody share some advice with me?","That's all good stuff, you've got your own place with a car and a career that's taking off. Consider how overwhelming it would be if you didn't have these things and you were trying to date Alexa.

&gt; Attachment and alone time. I have a tiny apartment - less than 400 square feet. She has been coming over and sleeping over. Usually this entails coming over around 7PM, and leaving around 11 or 12 in the morning. Honestly, I feel desperately ready for some space when she leaves near the end of it.

But when I'm with her, it's more of a peaceful feeling. Not drunk in love, or anything like that.

Peaceful feeling is good, right? I can definitely relate, if your place is too small then it can be annoying to have people over; it probably wouldn't be a good idea to move in together until you've got a bigger place for yourself. Otherwise this is something you'll have to get used to, since the alternative is that your gf stops coming over.

&gt; Commitment. It's super weird for me, now that I have someone I'm accountable to. I can't just ignore a text from her for an entire evening. I have to make an effort to see her multiple times a week. I can't just totally disappear. I'm still crazy attracted to other women, but it feels like I can't quite fantasize to the same way

This one is easy, if you break up with her then you'll have no problem being attached to other women. You'll never not be attracted to other women so there's really no solution other than getting over it. Also she's making the commitment to come over and taking the risk that she'll get pregnant from you, so answering texts and stuff is not the biggest weight in life.

&gt; Sex. It has been really hard so far. I am working to please he - we've been doing other 'stuff'. I have not yet been able to properly have sex wearing a condom, after a few tries. I believe I have a fairly large penis, and condoms are really tight.This has been humiliating. I also get horrible blue balls when we hold hands, or even make out.

I have considered talking to a doctor.

God, that's tragic. Actually this is the first thing you've said that is actually a legitimate issue. Condoms need to be tight or they're not going to work, but you know you can get them in different sizes. Try a few different brands / sizes and see if they're better. I think the blue balls thing is something that loads of guys get, I know I've heard other people complain about them, I think the real worry is if it ever completely goes away and you just don't find her attractive anymore. You'll probably get more used to her over time and kissing won't have the same effect on you. 

&gt; Telling my family. For whatever reason, I have a really tough time telling my parents I'm seeing someone. They are the 'teasing' type. Still, I know they'd be very happy to hear.

Then just don't tell them. If they're going to be annoying about it then there's no benefit to you. 

This stuff is absolutely in your head, and a lot of it is just trade-offs that you make for being in what seems to be a fairly good relationship. She finds you attractive and wants to spend time with you, and you want to spend time with her. It could be much worse and for many, many people, it is. Now you could solve all your problems by just breaking up, but I'm betting you'd rather not do that, so focus on the fact that the relationship is worth it.",0

&gt;can subreddits be reclaimed?

unfortunately no, but they may be able to be destroyed.  very popular subreddits have fallen in the past due to insane moderation.

**here's what we can do.**  the more people they ban like this, the more people they will turn against the sub.  eventually the drama will make it to the front page through word of mouth.

so let's help the mods ban ""problematic"" people.  let's give them a hand.  let's become their helpers.

make a new account that is not banned from me_irl, hasn't subbed or posted to /r/meirl or this subreddit, basically looking like a regular account in every way and can't be traced to your banned account.  if you can somehow change your IP address, even better, since I'm not sure whether subreddit mods can see IP's or not.  maybe go get an old alt that you have stashed away or make an alt just for this.

then use the website www.metareddit.com to search peoples comments in /r/me_irl.  search for ""bitch"", ""gay"", ""she's hot"", ""boobs"", ""tits"", ""retard"", anything and everything that those nutjobs have banned people for. (search using ""google"" to make it easier to see a bunch of results at once, and easier keep track of comments you've already done http://i.imgur.com/on9xG9E.png)  then report the comments.  the mods will ban the users, creating tons of negative publicity that will quickly spread through reddit, and further populating /r/meirl",That's so diabolically underhanded; I love it,0

The second does not say what you think it does, and since it's the only citation for the third I'll address them together. They say that post-transition trans people do worse *than the general population*, not than their pre-transition peers. Transition is enormously stressful and carries massive social cost, and in particular, the study you're talking about focused on people transitioning way back in the 80s. They note specifically:

&gt;&gt; In line with the increased mortality from suicide, sex-reassigned individuals were also at a higher risk for suicide attempts, though this was not statistically significant for the time period 1989–2003.

&gt;&gt; Transsexual individuals were at increased risk of being convicted for any crime or violent crime after sex reassignment (Table 2); this was, however, only significant in the group who underwent sex reassignment before 1989.

&gt;&gt; ... the overall mortality rate was only significantly increased for the group operated before 1989. However, the latter might also be explained by improved health care for transsexual persons during 1990s, along with altered societal attitudes towards persons with different gender expressions.

TL;DR: early transition treatments and shitty people explain the difference, not that transition is a bad thing in and of itself.

The last one's barely even worth addressing - it's a panicked bunch of religious conservatives similarly mis-citing the report from the previous two links and with literally one listed ""victory"" of a trans person who ""let the Lord into their heart"".","I know that no one in the West is  ""claiming the way Iran does things is a good idea.""  But shouldn't their nightmare version give us pause?

REGARDING 2ND AND THIRD ARTICLE:

So you admit that there is a higher suicide rate for post-""treatment"" transsexuals than the general population.  That's messed up. 

How do you know it's working? There is not a conclusive study comparing pre-treatment and post-treatment ""transsexuals."" You're OK with an 18% suicide attempt rate? You think that's acceptable? 

You blame society for their suicides. Society is becoming tolerant and non-discriminatory towards post-treatment transsexuals, and even worshiping the sexy ones in fashion magazines. We accept them as coworkers and don't discriminate against their promotion, but do you think society will ever accept it as normal healthy behavior for someone to  be talking in a register high above their natural normal register? When there are courses on how to talk more like a woman for post-treatment transpeople, how am I supposed to view their voice as anything but fake? You could even measure the resonance of sound using scientific instruments and conclude that it is mathematically un-aesthetic and not natural. A tenor saxophone sounds forced if they play in alto register. A B flat clarinet sounds most natural/open in B flat. This may seem like a shallow complaint and ego-centric (one could argue: they don't exist to please your ears), but it's  just one of many aspects that they are trying to force society (and straight men) to accept which society (and straight men) do not naturally accept. Why can't we just accept feminine guys? Why do they think they must conform to straight man's desire?",1

The above is especially thick. I've never seen a man called a TERF, always women. Men are usually called transphobes and/or right-wingers, etc. And I have ***never*** seen this level of vitriol towards them. It's actually so wild.

g05npqc,aznidentity,"I wrote this when that black guy was taking over the protest at the start. 

------------------------------------------
Disrespect for Asians. I consider the passiveness in this case to be a failure of Asians in standing up to blacks.

In this case it needs to be done subtly. Wait for the right moment when the crowd is tired of him talking. Then move in and take away the mic and start talking again to re-establish Asian leadership of the protest.

It is unacceptable to have black people taking over an Asian protest for Asian victims of racism. It makes us look so weak that we're unable to stand up for ourselves and need black people to do it for us.

In this case having black allies is an alliance, one formed by mutual interests that falls apart when the mutual interest is gone. It is the sort of case where it pays to always be ready for your allies to become your rivals. Remember that there are no permanent friends or allies, just permanent interests.

During the alliance there is cooperation but also competition. Competition over who leads, who contributes more, and who makes the most visible contributions that establishes who is higher and who is lower in the cooperative effort. When black people take over the protest they place themselves above Asians in the alliance and cooperative effort towards the mutually beneficial goal.

Another effect is that the ones who are highest in the cooperative effort end up reaping the most benefits from it. The ones who are lower end up being ignored with no one caring that they didn't reap any benefits. Do you like being lower in cooperative efforts? I've been there and I don't.

It's also a fallacy to say that feminism is only about challenging male power.

3xo8af,DebateFascism,"How do you expect certain groups of people to be accepting of your ideal Fascist society? First off, I would like to say that I know very little about Fascism and am here to learn. I am a Communist, but I do my best to respect others' beliefs, even if I disagree with them.

One thing I am confused about is that Fascism, to my knowledge, celebrates masculinity, xenophobia to some extent, and desires unity for a certain group of people. This makes me wonder; how can a Fascist movement really gain support if it excludes so many people? What kind of woman would want to live in a society that treats her in a way that treats her as subordinate, and prevents her from pursuing her own life goals? If a Fascist movement is nationalistic, that excludes a large amount of people who aren't of that nationality. What happens to them? What happens to homosexuals, minorities, people with disabilities?

How are those who don't support the movement treated? 

I'm sorry if I am not wording this well, but I have had this question on my mind for a while. I just don't understand how a movement like this would work and make sense if it is so exclusive. 

Again, I do not have much knowledge about Fascism, so please correct any misunderstandings I have expressed.","A well mannered Communist. Greetings. I'm surprised others haven't addressed this. But I guess I would answer your question with me own.

I instantly felt incredibly ashamed and blocked + deleted the account to remove the photos. I then grabbed a garbage bag and threw away all of the clothes, makeup, and toys that I had gathered over the years. I'm still worked up and freaking out over the whole thing. 

I'm 24 years old and I believe my sissy fetish came from using porn, starting age 10 and progressively moving on to harder and harder things. This combined with extremely low self esteem, I felt I couldn't be a real man, that I had to just give up and be a sissy for better guys. But this is no way to live, I want to find a girlfriend, I want to be an outgoing, interesting person that has great self esteem and inspires others. I feel lost and angry that I've stayed on my path for so many years. So much time, money and energy wasted dressing up, masturbating to sissy porn and imagining myself In that situation. I'm not a virgin but, I've never approached women I find attractive or am interested in, I've never had any confidence in my life, but this has to stop. Has anyone recovered from this ever? I need help and will do anything and everything I can to get my life back on track. I can't live this life another day, I'm turning 25 this year and this is not how I would have imagined my life 10 years ago. ","There's a lot to unpack here, so I'm just gonna go through parts and give my thoughts on it.

&amp;#x200B;
&gt; I've hit my all time low. I sent photos of me all dressed up to someone on grindr and I was going to meet with them.

I'm not gonna tell you why this is a bad idea or condemn you. This is not as bad as you think it is, you made a slip-up and messed up, but that's all it is. You're not a failure because you failed, nor are you less of a man because you did something like this. If anything you're more of a man because you saw that this was unhealthy and chose not to do it.
&gt; I then grabbed a garbage bag and threw away all of the clothes, makeup, and toys that I had gathered over the years. I'm still worked up and freaking out over the whole thing.

Like I said, don't let this destroy you, I would venture to guess you've hit your breaking point which is a good thing, your mind has finally woken up and realized that this has to stop, this is great.

&gt; I felt I couldn't be a real man, that I had to just give up and be a sissy for better guys.

You most certainly are a real man, the distorted view based off other men that you've seen is not the standard for masculinity. I won't lie to you, you have a ton of work ahead of you, a ton of hard and painful work. It's going to take a lot of self-introspection, self-control, and really miserable periods, but standing up and facing that stuff knowing the outcome will be worth it is what makes a man.

&gt; I want to find a girlfriend, I want to be an outgoing, interesting person that has great self esteem and inspires others.

You can do all of these things and they are very noble goals, make these your goals and continue to come up with ways that you can do this. I'm going to recommend you don't base your definition of an outgoing interesting person on other people, do some soul searching and find the interest that you genuinely want to explore, there's a version of you, the real you before you threw on these layers of crap that is unique and interesting, your goal should be to bring that you out and rediscover the person you really are.

You want to inspire others, how can you start doing that? Don't make excuses that you aren't ready to, or able to, just do it. You are a human who is struggling like everyone else on this planet, you can inspire people.

&gt; So much time, money and energy wasted dressing up, masturbating to sissy porn and imagining myself In that situation.

The best time to quit this stuff was 14 years, the second best time is right now, living in the past regretting this stuff is only giving it more power, it's time to move forward and start living your life. This stuff is an echo of your past, it's time to outgrow that past.

&gt; I've never approached women I find attractive or am interested in, I've never had any confidence in my life, but this has to stop.

Now's a great time to start, I'll recommend some books at the bottom. I would recommend you begin telling yourself affirmations about who you truly are each morning and lifting weights if you aren't already, make an effort to spend time with other men, being around men helps you get more in touch with your masculinity and will help with the confusion that this stuff creates. Find activities that you enjoy and are positive for you and begin working hard towards those.

&gt; Has anyone recovered from this ever?
I have not completely recovered, but my relationship with it is completely different. I haven't watched anything Hypno related in 6 months, went from doing anything with this almost every night to once every 1-2 weeks. My confidence has grown, I exercise regularly and am much more productive. When I relapse this stuff takes nothing but a few minutes now. I accept the relapse write down how I can prevent it in the future, and get right back on track.

&gt; I need help and will do anything and everything I can to get my life back on track.
I'll be happy to help in any way I can, feel free to dm me. I highly recommend an accountability partner, I have several and they've helped more than anything. 

Shoot for abstaining from this stuff, if you relapse, don't let it take anything else, pull yourself up accept that failing doesn't make you a failure, and channel your energy into something positive. You can get rid of this stuff, you can change your life, and any beliefs that this stuff has told you or you've told yourself about how you can't is a lie. This is a sports game, the score looks bad right now, but that doesn't mean the game is over.

&gt; I can't live this life another day, I'm turning 25 this year and this is not how I would have imagined my life 10 years ago.

There are tons of people who have taken way longer to finally make a change, you're ahead of many people who are struggling to beat this addiction. It's time to start fighting back, this stuff is gonna be gone from your life by the time you turn 30.

You can do this, it's gonna be hard, it's gonna be tons of work, but you can do this, and when it's over you'll be able to look back on it and take pride knowing you did it, not anyone else.

I believe in you man!",0

fh8qgpu,GenderCynicalCritical,"Yup, I get to sleep in every morning and I'm STILL a woman 😊

Hell, tons of actual women get up 45+ minutes or even HOURS early to ""get ready"" because they feel like they're obligated to in order to be able to participate in the world. But then, not all women have the luxury of waking up hours early to do their hair and makeup, some have to use that time to commute, take care of kids, or go to the nearest water source to collect their family's water for that day. Guess what? They're still more of women than any man could ever be.","Some of us are fortunate enough to work someplace where we’re not pressured to look super “feminine”.

ezetauh,Ask_Radical_Feminists,"Think about *why* that might be (Not that I agree, I'm just engaging in conversation here).

Let's say you're a 25 year old American man, there are more women than men in that demographic. If we take out 10% from each group to address homosexuality, the proportion is still going to stay about the same.

Incel philosophy says ""It's because women are all fucking Chad and he has sex with lots of women!"" but that isn't necessarily true. [""Chad"" is having less sex, too](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/the-sex-recession/573949/). Despite what the forums are saying, there isn't some Ubermench out there taking all the ladies, and the women aren't having sex with a new guy every night. If anything, women *mind less.* They aren't forming a lot of online communities around the identity of not-having-sex because, compared to men in that same age group, they just *don't care.*","Why do you think there are more young women than young men in US? All the sources I have seen says the opposite. Example: https://overflow.solutions/demographic-data/the-male-to-female-ratio-of-america-by-age-range/ where it says that first at age 40 are there more women than men.

2mo1el,trolling,"Is this the best place to post these when I get home or what? Trolls of reddit guide me.... or troll wut evs So last night my girlfreind and I decided it woulld be amusing to go on her pof account and troll any guys that are creepy or perverted and get some good laughs out of it. She is pretty gorgeous so pretty much every time we refresh her inbox there are 3 new messages and one of them is new and potentially a creepy troll candidate. We have 2 rules... They cant have kids and we dont troll people that seem genuine and nice that are just looking for that someone. So that being said the trolling escalated quickly and hilariity ensued. Long story short we trolled about 6-7 creeps with terrible game over the course of about 2 hours and the end result was us creating an email for the sole purpose of having a place for the creeps to send their troll induced naughty photos to. So far we got a got who refers to his package of questionable size that he refered as a ""meat cleaver"" in a boxer briefs mirror selfie, and when we woke up there were 2 full on dick pics from another gentle man who we are pretty sure was wasted. We have no intention of posting the pics but we do want to post the convos as they are funny, but we dont know the best place to do so and were also thinking after we have a relatively full inbox of screenshoting the email inbox to show ppl how many crazy creeps are willing to send random trolls pics. Lastly we are trying to think of the best way to let them know they are being punked we were thinking of maybe a classy rick rolling? So my questions are as follows

Where is the best place on reddit to post this hilarity? Are we breaking the law in any way? (Pretty sure that is not seeking legal council, sorry if I am mistaken?) How do we end the troll sequences in the funniest way possible.
","You could say things like ""Are you actually looking for a long term relationship, or are you just looking for a quick fuck?"" then, when they obviously say ""I'm looking for a relationship"" (because that's what they'll think you want to hear) then you can say something like ""oh that's a shame I thought you were really cute.

ekv3osf,Radical_Feminists,"No, those people are nihilists, which is not radical. Radical feminism is utopian, in the accurate, not derogatory sense. Utopia is a practical blueprint for a future just society without hierarchies - see Ursula Le Guin's feminist utopias. If you (general you) don't believe in revolution, then I don't know why you are a revolutionary (radical). Please don't allow nihilists to get you down or to make you think this is normal or at all politically smart to have this kind of attitude. Political activism is about hope, faith, celebrating each other, and mourning for and making meaningful the suffering of women over the centuries. It's about survival and struggle and faith, not a lay down and die attitude. Pessimism, nihilism and apocalypticism are all false ideologies, not realistic ways of looking at the world, and they are likely to be exacerbated by mental illness. We need to see both the beauty and goodness as well as horror and evil in the world. When you feel too unbalanced in one direction, like negativity, we need to surround ourselves with the other pole of positivity until our minds rebalance and we can look at the world realistically again. We are intelligent and capable - our brains are amazing. When we are mentally healthy, we can find near-miraculous solutions for the worst problems. Read accounts of historical struggles - we are hardly the first people to face (and hopefully overcome) apocalyptic end-of-the-world scenarios.

By the way, Third World women like myself are far more at risk of climate change than Western women. I find this apocalyptic nihilistic attitude annoying coming from the people most responsible for climate change and least likely to suffer from it.","Hey I’m curious about your background, since you bring it up pretty much every chance you get and use it as an appeal every time, which makes it relevant. 

I probably don’t recall correctly, but I thought you lived perhaps in India? And you lived in, was it the United States for something like the second half of your childhood? Am I confusing you for someone else?

I’ve known a lot of people from third world countries who lived in America. The people I’ve met from India who were living here now, probably because of how I met them, were all incredibly wealthy. Casually-talking-about-their-servants wealthy. My understanding is that class differences in third world countries are a pretty big deal. People in the third world aren’t all going to be fucked over by climate change the same. Just the same as everywhere else. The rich are going to be significantly better off than the poor. 

You act like everyone in a first world country is a spoiled brat who has nothing to worry about and has enough power to be responsible for something like climate change - as if we have the power to stop it, to stop the whole capitalist system that is driving this. Meanwhile by some measures parts of the US are as bad as a third world country in wealth inequality. You imply people like me don’t have a right to be afraid of climate change, and that we should feel especially guilty for it. I just think about the time my dad kicked me out of the house when I was a teenager and I thought I’d find a place in the woods to hide and sleep. Instead it was almost comical because the forest was full of homeless men. I’d be trying to get 10 meters away from the last guy and I’d nearly bump into another guy. All those privileged American pricks are going to be fine when the weather gets even more extreme, right? They can’t get their needs met now, but things won’t get worse, right?

I grew up poor. I stayed in a homeless shelter with my mom. I almost attacked someone I love over some food once because I was a bit traumatized about food availability from my childhood. I was pissed about capitalism. I spent my early adulthood trying to figure out how to end it. But it’s not on me. I didn’t have the power and the socialist movement here was destroyed and had the potential sucked out of it before I was born. 

I think anyone who actually went through any kind of scarcity would understand why people are upset about and planning for climate change. Climate change is already affecting everyone. It doesn’t stop at first world borders. The American ruling class is likely to be okay. The ruling classes in other countries are likely to be okay. The rest of us are not. 

Anyway, I think your appeal to a “balanced” mindset about this calamity is fallacious. The “things can be okay” side of the equation is no longer equal to the “things will not be okay” side, and it doesn’t make sense to treat them as equal when they are not. Sorry if that is “annoying.” But I’ve been through enough shit to have earned my pessimism, and I don’t owe you a cheerful, blindly optimistic attitude.",2

g65j8o6,RedPillWives,"Take time to do things that bring you life! It’s hard to be social right now but perhaps you could do something you really love while baby naps? I knit while my daughter naps and it helps me unwind and accomplish something at the same time! And integrate baby into your chores! Laundry is the hardest one for me, but helping with dishes or cooking (playing with kitchen utensils) makes it’s easier to get things done when she is awake!

Perhaps also finding the real source of your exhaustion! Some days I find are harder than others (I am at home with a 10 month old) and it’s usually because I’ve forgotten to eat, drink or get fresh air! Going for walks downtown in and out of stores helps me socially unwind and gives the baby some fresh air and exposure to people as well. 

The hardest thing I’ve found, since covid has destroyed our social lives, is getting the same social release as my husband! He is socializing all day with people and is usually very tired when he gets home from work, so if I get the chance to chat with others during the day I find I’m less annoying at night when he gets home! 

Sharing the load is also important! Sometimes while I make dinner I hand my daughter off to him for some 1–1 playtime which they both enjoy!

Finally take your days in strides and give yourself grace! Being a mom is hard and you’re allowed to be tired. Keep your communication open with your husband about your day but try to remember the fun and good parts! Take your day for what it is!",You're absolutely right! I do so much better on the days that I can set up play dates and chat the day away - I don't feel the need to chat at my husband all night when he's exhausted after being in meetings all day. I'm working on incorporating the little one into more chores and so far I think it's helping a little bit. Thank you ♥,0

d2ydpz1,NationalSocialism,"[Black pride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_pride)

&gt;Black pride is a movement in response to dominant white cultures and ideologies that encourages black people to celebrate black culture and embrace their African heritage.

Key phrase: ""a movement in response to dominant white cultures and ideologies"".

[Asian pride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_pride)

&gt;In the United States, Asian pride is a slogan primarily used by Asian separatist, Asian nationalists, and Asian pride organizations to signal their viewpoints.

Slightly odd that the language is different, but AFAIK Asian pride is less outspokenly racist compared to, say, white pride.

Edit: Google white pride rally. Now google asian pride rally. See what I mean?

[White pride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_pride)

&gt;White pride is a motto primarily used by white separatist, white nationalist, neo-Nazi and white supremacist organizations to signal their racist or racialist viewpoints

Technically this is true. White pride (and asian pride for that matter) are a form of racism and racialism.

[Gay pride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_pride)

&gt;Gay pride or LGBT pride is the positive stance against discrimination and violence toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people

Disclaimer: gay is not a race.

Arguments tend to work better if they are based in, you know, the truth.","This is probably the most pathetic attempt at making an argument i've ever seen someone try on this subreddit. 

""In response to dominant white cultures""

There will always be a dominant culture, at any point. In White nations, White culture is dominant. No one goes to Africa or Asia etc. and says they need to stop being the dominant culture and just fade away. Colonialism when you don't like it ""Diversity"" when it suits you. 

People that claim to be against racism only use that as an opportunistic mask of ""morality"" to use against Whites only. 

Also bud, I didn't make an argument, I simply posted pictures and that's all I had to do to prove Jewpedia says racial pride is literally ok for everyone except Whites. 

""Gay is not a race, therefore everything else mentioned no longer matters"" 

lol. Thats the funniest part of this ultra pathetic reply. 

""Less outspokenly racist than White pride""

Yes, it's only racist when White people have a sense of racial unity, we all get it here kiddo.

I am not surprised they are doing this as I am sure there is some crossover between the two shows as Thundercats Roar! is aiming for the same audience.

What gets me though is from what I could gather from the first two episodes of Thundercats Roar is that they almost are aiming at the original audience, but shitting on them at the same time.  

The origin of Roar is just a truncated and goofy version of the original, but they don't mention that Lion-O is supposed to be the same age of WilyKit and WilyKat, but Jaga messed with his stasis pod so that his body would mature while they traveled to third Earth. That would have been the PERFECT excuse to make Lion-O as stupid as he is and the other adult Thundercats would have to raise a literal Man-Child.  But they just made Lion-O a dipshit for no especially great reason.  

Thundercats 2011 was at least trying something different with the material and tried to elevate it with its serialized story and more mature characters.  I guess some things are too good for this world.

I am curious if they got the original voice of Lion-O to do it too. I checked his IMDB (Larry Kenney) and he was Jaga in the pilot and has done a sprinkling of voice work over the last few years.",0

giubpx9,Intactivists,"In the 1980s, when my parents discussed their birth plan, they decided not to circumcise me because 1) my dad is an intact European and 2) the doctor said there really isn't good reason, it's just something cultural. Growing up in America, my Jewish mother's only worry was that I would be teased. And you know what? I was teased. I was very ashamed of my foreskin. Pinhole phimosis added insult to injury. Eventually, after a lot of unsuccessful stretching and a desire to see and feel my glans, I got a therapeutic circumcision at the end of puberty. It was my choice, even though I probably could have used more information about what I would lose.

Even with all the shame and teasing, I would still **never** circumcise my child. It's his body, not mine. After seeing how painful the procedure is for a six foot tall grown man, my sister couldn't imagine doing that to a baby. My nephew will grow up intact, just like me. My sister preaches the importance of leaving boys intact to any would-be mom she encounters. More and more Americans are starting to wake up.

We need to be careful about the language intactivists use. We need to start with less inflammatory language. It riles people up and a lot of men would have to confront their own lack of agency. It makes men angry. If we start with gentler terms, we can then ease into how horrific it is that we routinely take something away from baby boys without their consent. Words like *mutilate* are precise and accurate, but off-putting. I don't actually know another word to use, but I'll brainstorm something.

Oh, and if anyone were to ask: I miss my foreskin dearly, but recognize that I am glad circumcision was a medical option I had in my late-teenage years. The key is that I consented. I consented. Not my parents. Me.","There's no such thing as therapeutic circumcision. Amputation is not a valid treatment for phimosis

e4wqfzb,AganistGayMarriage,"&gt;surely you follow the ten commandments? the one that says ""love thy neighbour""

Not one of the ten commandments. While that mistake is forgivable, it highlights how many biblical teachings are taken out of context or used in ways contrary to their actual meaning, primarily due to ignorance. You can read more about that particular command here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Commandment

&gt;even if you think that being gay is a sin or whatever

Yes, and something being a sin isn't merely something like preferring chocolate when vanilla is the one true flavor. We believe that it is a behaviour that causes grave harm to those who commit it and those around them.

&gt;surely youd still be nice to them?

Being ""nice"" isn't a virtue, and even in a secular worldview people who think like that just end up a doormat. The real way to show love is to teach them the error of their ways so they don't continue down a path that leads to destruction.

&gt;whats wrong with letting people who you think are ""mentally ill"" be happy and in a loving relationship **which in no way interferes with you?**

Why do we have child abuse laws? Or domestic abuse laws? Those actions in no way interfere with my life, as I was neither abused nor will do so. Turns out societies that allow for that sort of thing don't do as well as those that prohibit it. The point here is that no action exists in a vacuum. We live in a society. Just because you believe something is meaningless and inconsequential does not make it so. 

This includes all the facets of homosexual life, including but not limited to: higher rates of domestic rape, nearly 80x higher chance of contracting HIV/AIDS, the complete obliteration of monogamy in the subculture, and the general inclination towards hedonism and nihilism the view necessitates.

&gt;another thing, dont you believe that everybody sins? only God can judge right? what gives you the right to assume what God thinks about gay people? has God told you himself?

No, God has the final judgement but we must take responsibility over ourselves and our actions. ""Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces."" - Matthew 7:6

Also God has made evident the error of this sort of behavior, both in the preceding societal effects it has, and that thing called the bible some people like.

https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A24-27&amp;version=NIV

To be fair this passage requires the context of the general character of God and how and why he is merciful or wrathful. Here though an important take away is that this sort of sin is so bad that it's essentially the last thing before eternal separation from God, which is the classical view of Hell.

you talk about ""grave harm"" etc when talking about the future paths of homosexuals, what kind of harm are you talking about? if it is something like suicide, dont you think that if many people told you that your human attraction and way of thinking was sinful, you would feel a bit shit, no? its the same as being attracted to the opposite gender, can you help that? i am straight, and i cannot help that. i cant just say, the way im thinking is sinful so i shall stop,because its so deeply rooted into who i am ; not that i define myself by my sexuality, but it is deeply rooted into who i am sexually.


&gt;The real way to show love is to teach them the error of their ways

the thing is, not everyone shares your view. not everyone is a christian, or holds your values and your subjective morals and what is good or bad. sure, you can be christian and thats cool. im an atheist, and thats cool too. the thing is, nobody knows whats right. you cannot say 100% that you are right, and neither can i. its merely philosophical, and subjective to who you are as a person.

with this in mind, why do you think that makes it okay to tell people how they should live there life, abiding by **your** morals? your morals, i assume, come from the same subjective belief of right and wrong? sure, as much as i dont like saying, you can think that being gay is a sin. but what makes your sense of right and wrong different to absolutely anyone elses, and what gives you the right to tell people what to believe?


&gt;Why do we have child abuse laws? Or domestic abuse laws?

i cant believe this is part of your point dude. but i guess i genuinely have to say:   
child abuse is **non-consentual** abuse of a child, a child who **cannot give consent** due to underage. domestic abuse is **non-consentual**. two men / women in a loving relationship is **consentual** and hurts nobody.

pulling statistics about HIV/AIDS proves literally nothing about anything. higher rates of domestic rape sure, but someone being gay does not affect their own moral compass or cognitive capabilities or whatever. there are many different reasons this could be. also, could you show your sources? not that i doubt it, just so i can confirm it.

&gt;we must take responsibility over **ourselves** and **our** actions

748zou,Egalitarianism,What do you think of MRAs and Femenists? As someone new to this I wana hear your opinions on these 2 groups.,"Disclosure: I'm an MRA.

I actually see MRAs and feminists as being very similar, and I actually think that's as it should be. Feminists are advocates for women and pretty much only women; MRAs are advocates for men and only men. Essentially, they're demographic advocacy groups, and as such, they both have biases that favor that demographic and result in prejudices and failures in empathy against the opposite gender. Both groups deny this, but both are guilty of it in my experience. MRAs and feminists, at least on a basic level, are far more similar than most of them would like to admit.

That being said, there are differences. Feminism is much older than the MRM, and as such, has developed a sophisticated philosophy and set of theories about gender inequality, which MRAs neither boast nor desire. Feminism is inseparable from its theories; there are women's rights advocates (WRAs) who do not subscribe to feminist views of gender inequality. By contrast, the MRM has no such ideological foundation, but it does find unity in anti-feminism. Practically all MRAs are critical of feminism to some extent, whereas there are still probably some feminists who haven't even heard of MRAs. 

Feminism tends to be firmly in bed with liberal politics, whereas MRAs consist of a more varied mix of conservatives and liberals. Public perception would tell you that MRAs are overwhelmingly conservative/right-wing, but this just isn't true in my experience. 

While both groups tend to have disdain for the other, currently the forms that disdain takes are a little different. Feminist opinions of MRAs seem to range from ""they're all just misogynists in civil rights' clothing"" to ""they mean well, but they attack feminists too much,"" to ""MRA? What's that?"", whereas MRA opinions of feminists range from ""they're female supremacists who want to enslave men,"" to ""they don't hate men, they just don't give a fuck what happens to them,"" to ""they mean well, but are subconsciously biased against men."" Basically, feminists seem to view the MRM as toxic, unnecessary, and irrelevant, while MRAs view feminism as toxic, oppressive, and (a minority) unnecessary.

The only reason I side with the MRM is because I think feminism has a monopoly on the gender debate, is biased against men and has been for a long time, and thus gender equality will never be achieved under feminism alone. Men need advocates in this discussion, so I support the MRM to create a more balanced gender discussion. If this was still the 1950's, I'd probably be a feminist, because I would see women having the greater need at that time. ",0

I often just read through them for fun, but since I'm gay I felt like yesterday was a day to actually make some points.  And I feel like I understand where you are coming from.  Plenty of people on both sides were massively insulting, condescending, or rude.  I spent a long time trying to answer various arguments against gay marriage, and keeping a friendly tone as best I could, but some people would simply drop a comment about backwards retards and never come back.  (Of course, I was called a well-educated idiot, it definitely went both ways.)

What I want you to realize is that there are a lot reasonable people on both sides, but there are a lot more angry people who take to the messaging boards to complain or mock.  They are the vocal minority who the opposing side sees everywhere.  You don't see the minority on your side because (presumably) your friends are reasonable people.  But believe you me, they are there - just beyond your circle of friends.  I don't see the minority on my side unless I too enter the battlefield that is the facebook page of fox news.

As for celebration - I wouldn't take the celebration as mocking of the opposing side.  A lot of people, myself included, are genuinely thrilled by the supreme court decision.

&amp;nbsp;

To make a long story short, I am a 21 year old woman. I have been a gender-critical, porn-critical Radfem for about two years now. I have always been porn-critical and have never accepted porn use in my partners, since I started dating in high school. I have always had a 0 tolerance policy for it and my boyfriends have obliged me because they wanted to be with me. My current partner never enjoyed porn because of it's dehumanizing nature and had quit it altogether before we met. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have many male friends and continue to make male friends at work, in college classes, etc. I used to never think of their porn use because I didn't see it as my concern. However, since becoming a Radfem I can't stop being aware of what is probably going on with all these men who supposedly care about me. To me, there's a massive logical fallacy if you claim to love even ONE woman in your life, but are aroused or masturbate to women suffering. If you support the porn industry and have never once thought about what you're consuming, you don't love women. You don't love me, because I AM those women. There's no difference between me and some other young woman out there who happened to be less fortunate.

&amp;nbsp;

 It's like men don't get this. They lack the awareness and the empathy. It can't help but make me feel like they are all sociopaths. It hurts me because I love my male friends but how can I pretend like I'm not aware that they are like this? I feel awful getting close to any man beside my boyfriend. I feel like porn culture is so all-consuming that I can't ignore how it's lurking under every man's interactions with me. Imagine knowing you care for people who fundamentally don't see you or women like you as human beings and are incapable of even understanding why you are in that position. I want to honestly just forget about interacting with men as friends because of this, but I get sucked in by their personalities and the stuff we have in common--only to remember what they really are like when they are alone. How do I cope with this?","I understand you are hurting and to frank, yeah, many men do it, and it’s terrible. But it actually really isn’t all.

csjao3,KotakuInAction,"How come video game music despite being inferior to other mediums (esp film and TV) in overall quality, is the easiest to listen to on a repeat and arguably best for a marathon of nonstop loop (minus to say actual stuff intended to be sold as stand alone music)? I saw this post.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/c2xz84/why\_is\_gaming\_standards\_for\_artistic\_elements/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/c2xz84/why_is_gaming_standards_for_artistic_elements/)

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to ask this. I'm not a connoisseur of video game music and agree with the redditor OP in the link that other mediums have far superior stuff. But I notice despite far inferior quality to music outside of gaming, its very easy to get addicted to gaming OST and put it on a loop as you are waiting in an airport or riding a bus. Even very old primitive console stuff a la MS Dos and NES I find myself listening to on repeat unintentionally simply because I just think they are so catchy despite being objectively terrible in say film standards.

&amp;#x200B;

The only music I find easier and better for looping and much easier to forget its the 100th time you listened to the whole single track to is religious music and actual standalone music, the type that you have bands like the Beatles specifically creating to be sold as only as music and not to accompany a radio drama's background or TV arc's conclusion.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the reason? I mean as awe inspiring as say many movies like the John Wayne's Alamo, its easy to get bored of it after the 40th repeat. Same for ost and even real songs of radio drama, musicals and opera, and TV (though the exception is anime opening and endings which usually originally created to sell as standalone and simply tacked on to use in the anime as licensed advertising).

&amp;#x200B;

How did gaming far surpass music elsewhere except for stuff intended to be as commercial radio singles and live band music along with religious chants? What did gaming successfully get that makes Beatles and Church Choir so easy to listen to all day that other mediums esp movies often fail to capture and match?","Archive links for this discussion:

Then, the other day I saw a post from anti-radical feminists saying that 2nd wave feminists “hated TERFs too” and included a quote from Leslie Feinberg:
“We’re in danger of losing what the entire second wave of feminism, what the entire second wave of women’s liberation was built on, and that was ‘Biology is not destiny’. ‘One is not born a woman,’ Simone de Beauvoir said, ‘one becomes one’.

bmto6i,RedPillWomen,"Dating is destroying my self esteem and confidence..  

You really need a lot of self esteem and confidence before dating because it can be tough

In my immediate family, the women did not do a lot of dating. My mom met my dad very young and they've been together for many years. And my sister married her high school boyfriend. My best friend married the second guy she dated. They are all normal and don't have nearly the self esteem issues that I have that stems from rejection.

My self esteem is shattered and I have inadequacies that I don't think will ever go away even with the help of a therapist. I just don't understand how somebody can have sex with you, laugh and joke with you on the regular then disappear with no explanation at all. How can somebody do all of that and not even want a relationship? I'm a simple girl. If I like you enough to sleep with you on a regular basis, and enjoy it, then I want a relationship. I don't run across a lot of guys that I really like (and they like me back) and connect with, so when I find \*one\* I want to make it official. Now, I have a hard time moving on because I want closure. I have a hard time functioning everyday because of this huge void inside.

No more casual sex. I hate the idea of the guy possibly ending things because he found somebody he truly likes/loves and wants to be in a relationship with, while all I got was just sex. So while i'm still single, he's cuddled up with his girlfriend. It angers me. I can't hold my head up high or have any pride now.

All the dates that I went on that turned into nothing. I feel like an idiot for trying to have confidence when no man really wants me. I feel like a fraud.

I avoid Facebook like the plague. I'll probably have an emotional breakdown if I see one of them in a picture with a girlfriend. I wont be able to handle it and will probably wind up in a mental institution","&gt;If I like you enough to sleep with you on a regular basis, and enjoy it, then I want a relationship.

bax9de,Amberlynn,"Is ALR....special? I’m new to the colossal train wreck that is Amberlynn’s life, and I have a question: is she a little slow? Or something? 

The first thing that hit me was the way she speaks. It took me a minute to figure out that the “opptiveea” meals that she calls “feeleens” are probably supposed to be “fuelings.” Ok, sure, close enough I guess. And who is “gorl?” I keep imagining that “Gorl” is some poor unfortunate YouTube viewer who’s parents randomly drew scrabble tiles to fill in her birth certificate. There are other words but these are the best.

She also doesn’t seem to understand how basic things work, like cooking. I know that cooking is a skill and it takes a while to learn, but really gorl? Sure, adding a bunch of giant onion chunks to a pot of cold liquid is is one way to do it, but it’s not the right way. Most people, even if they don’t really know how to cook, can figure out how heat, fat, and moisture will react together. Also, anyone with a basic literacy level can follow a recipe.

Which brings me to the next question: does she know how to count and do basic math? Seriously, I’m concerned that she missed everyday of math class in every year of school. I mean, no, an entire roll of tube turkey, 5 cups of brown rice, and all the Mrs. Dash in the known universe does not equal 11 WW points. It just doesn’t. Also, in the one Torrid haul I managed to get through, she kept introducing items and saying they were size 5 and 6 “now this one is size 5.” But 5 and 6 are different numbers, and therefore, different sizes. Why? Just because it’ll be a fun adventure to see if she can get this 5 on  her body? She also can’t seem to tell the difference between shirts and dresses, which is a little disturbing.

I could go on, but I think you get my point. I’m really wondering if she’s challenged. Thanks.","I’ll give an explanation the best I can
The reason she talks like that, per our speculation is because she’s trying to be more ‘country’ and imitate the people around her in Kentucky so she forces herself to have a drawl. ‘Gorl’ is a funny term to describe how Amber pronounces ‘girl’ so we always use it in replacement.

The onion thing has to do with Becky hating onions so Amber just makes huge chunks so it’s easy for Becky to pick out and I imagine when Amber gets her bowl she just peels the onion layers apart to eat it

With the weight watchers thing I’m just gonna day that she can’t control the points since weight watchers does but our gorl is a liar so she might know what she’s doing but she can’t deceive the real numbers",0

I don't see the problem with the schools action. If it was a police officer who was accused of rape, I expect them to be suspended, pending investigation rather than continue working. I know that's a bit different than a student, since a student isn't in any position of authority, but taking no action doesn't seem correct either, considering the act being alleged is a violent one.

Being a virgin really doesn't matter much. Yes, I've got a bit of more knowledge about their anatomy. But that won't help me last any longer. I am the pure relationship kind of guy. That means, if I sleep with a woman for the first time I

* haven't had sex in a while (new relationship)

* am madly in love with that person

You bet I won't last even one minute after we start. That's what round two is for. Or try and explore with your hands, find out what she likes (just watch her... you'll see it).

Not being a virgin does nothing for lasting longer the first time(s). Getting a regular sex life going does. And if we don't see each other for two weeks... then it'll be over fast once more. Hey, I've got other tools to use :)

- Men's liberation movement: Part of feminism and runs somewhat parallel to it and takes a feminist approach to male issues and is therefore explicitly pro women. -&gt; r/MensLib

- Masculism (this sub): Focuses on the hardships, problems, but also benefits of masculinity or being male, both personal and societal. Its typically neutral towards women, simply because its rarely relevant to its discourse.

- Masculinism: The smallest group, openly advocates androcentrism, patriarchy and male superiority, which makes them almost always heavily misogynistic.

nwprsf,nametheproblem,Oxfam training guide blames ‘privileged white women’ over root causes of sexual violence ,"&gt; **An Oxfam staff training document says “privileged white women” are supporting the root causes of sexual violence by wanting ""bad men"" imprisoned.**

In the wake of sex scandals that have rocked the charity, Oxfam has produced guidance which states that: “Mainstream feminism centres on privileged white women and demands that ‘bad men’ be fired or imprisoned”.

Accompanied by a cartoon of a crying white woman, it adds that this “legitimises criminal punishment, harming black and other marginalised people”.

&gt; It advises staff to read a controversial book which concludes: “Mainstream feminism is supporting, not undoing, the root causes of sexual violence.”

Oxfam said that the training was voluntary, and the views are not presented as its own but designed to help staff understand the issues.

However, **the charity was warned on Wednesday night that the document, compiled by its LGBT network and seen by The Telegraph, could breach equality laws as it suggests reporting rape is ""contemptible"".**

&gt; The four-week “learning journey” recommends that staff read Me Not You: The Trouble with Mainstream Feminism, a book by Alison Phipps, a professor of gender studies at the University of Sussex.

Summarising the book’s central premise, the Oxfam document says white feminists need to ask themselves whether they are causing harm when they fight sexual violence.",0

d7xq6od,KotakuInAction,"So they start taxing people for speech. Some program becomes dependent on that revenue. The people catch on and alter their speech to avoid the fines. The program loses funding so then they need to broaden the definition of offensive speech to keep revenue up further narrowing speech in the UK.

Then Some politicians base growth of the program on projected increase in revenue via such fines. So again the police are pressured to more aggressively prosecute speech to meet the new quota.

It happens with tickets and fines in the US and was a major point of contention between the people of Ferguson and the police. Federal authorities investigated the Ferguson police and found they were being pushed to increase the number of tickets year after year to meet demand for increased revenue.


Once government gets its hands on increased taxes (Through fines or otherwise) they spend it on growing the government. That revenue than becomes expected and is almost impossible to shrink government. Once a bill passes unless there is an expiration date it's not going anywhere. The same will happen with all the cash coming in from policing speech. They won't let it go and will need to take extreme measures to see the funding keeps coming in. Like with red light cameras. Once the population adapts to their presence in order to keep up funding they change the timing on the yellow light to increase the number of tickets issued. This ultimately causes more accidents but it's okay how else will they fund exorbitant government contracts for their friends in the private sector who funded their campaign?","Isn't that such a great system?

ce5q9yp,anarchy,"&gt;If anything, Noel Ignatiev confirms that racialists and identitarians are natural allies of propertarian libertarians.

And I think this is one reason why you see such rampant racism and white supremacy among ancaps.  Whiteness was designed as a strategy to divide the working class and to solidify property and capitalist relations.  This is maintained through what DuBois called the ""wages of whiteness"" -- essentially a whole series of privileges that turn the white worker against the rest of the working class, forging instead a cross-class alliance with the rich.","These ""privileges"" that you speak of are nothing more than the economic result of people's preferences to act favorably towards those close to them. For example, people tend to be much more willing to make sacrifices to benefit members of the same family, clan, community or race than to benefit outsiders. People tend to respect the property rights of those similar to them than to respect the property rights of foreigners. Homogeneity therefore reduces risks and increases trust and social cohesion. There are no statutes today that compel people to subsidize their own affiliations; this is done voluntarily according to people's preferences. Social categories such as these are per se voluntary and preferential, as is discrimination.

Given that homogeneity and identitarianism serve to enforce property and division of labor, how is in my interest as a capitalist to endorse the abolition of social categories? How exactly do anarcho-capitalists benefit from cooperating with anti-whites such as Noel Ignatiev?",0

Anyways, not sure what your intentions with this girl is...  you said you have been decent friends for years, and yet you're now suddenly texting her a lot?  Like, is this just a friend, or what?

Dude - you're probably youngish, I would just ask and get some input so that you can have better relationships with women in the decades ahead...  And as you said you guys are decent friends, so it shouldn't be bad to ask should it?  All relationships probably have some bumps in the road here and there, and yeah, if you can't navigate the first one...  Sorry - not pointing a finger at you.  Like, this girl isn't engaging with you, so for her there was maybe a ""bump in the road"", and maybe its her that doesn't have the emotional intelligence to navigate it.

And is someone that just writes you off at the first bump in the road worth any more investment?  But yeah, not sure what your intentions are.

I probably shouldn't be in this sub :-D  Just here to pick up some skills around engaging with others, not seduction.  Hope there was something useful in my response.","Well to be fair I have been in a relationship before (when I first met her). By the time I broke up she was in a relationship but we were friends.

I decided to shoot my shot a week ago and it started going really well, then she left me on read. And now I’m trying to figure out if she’s playing games with me or whether I pushed her away by not being seductive enough. Definitely think I have a lot to learn from this sub!",0

ahwwpw,Trufemcels,"How to stop feeling jealous? I'm not sure if I'm a femcel. But I feel a deep sense of disgust at people on relationships or people who have had sex or loving relationships. I'm probably just really lonely and bitter because I've never been laid or whatever but it's not about being laid to me. I want to be loved and respected, in bed or not. But that's something I've never felt and I don't feel like I can ever feel (I can go and get sex if I tried, but like I said before, it's meaningless and purposeless). I feel jealous of people who have had that experience before, even if I get the feeling that they might be into me or if I am interested in them. It feels like I'll end up being just an extra (bad) experience for them, and I'll be just have been used for sex when things end. So I never end up in relationships, or ever do it with anyone. 

I don't know why I'm so paranoid or have this sort of thinking. ","I can relate. In the very few sexual experiences I've had, at the last minute, I tried to get out of sex because I already knew the dude didn't care about me. And lo and behold, none of them ever messaged me again. 

A friend was talking about how her last dates essentially fell for her and did so many nice things for her and she couldn't take it because she needs time to grow feelings for someone and these guys latched on so fast. I have never had a guy take me on a date, talk less of a fancy steak dinner. If I didn't like the girl a lot already, I probably would've been raging jealous but it's more like pity for myself. 

Honestly just protect your heart as much as you can. Be jealous but don't act on it in such a way that endangers you (which it seems like you have a handle on). I would rather feel like I have more control of ny life than feel used. ",0

de32t7r,uncensorednews,"I know nothing of the Bavarian government, so I've decided just to not say anything about it instead of what I was going to say.","As a Bavarian CSU voter I'm somewhat conflicted. Keep in mind that even though the CSU is the conservative party in Bavaria, compared to the US they are more like a mix of left wing Democrats with light libertarian trends. We are not Germany's Texas.

Ok, so critics would say that it's just a populist move. That it's somewhat of a non issue in Bavaria. Don't alienate muslims. Freedom of religion, freedom of expression etc.. 

On the other hand you can argue that it's a political move to keep more extreme right wing parties at bay, by actually listening to what the general population wants. Which is probably the secret of the CSU's success over the last decades. You can argue that full-face vails are a security risk, since you can't identify people. You can make the argument that it suppresses women, but you would probably have to do a case by case study for that.

Last summer I was at a public pool on one of the hottest days of the year. I'm sitting there in the shade of a cafe by the pool, while having some ice cream. A muslim couple came by and took place at a table over. He had the typical beard, actually started reading the Koran and was wearing swim trunks. Besides him his wife, wearing a burka. All around us, women in bikinis. I'm trying not to judge here, but even if I wasn't suppressed, I would at least feel incredibly stupid as his wife.

In conclusion I think there is no easy right or wrong answer, but it's certainly within a governments right to prohibit face veils or masks in government buildings. Banning it in public would be a different thing.",0

4daxez,RedPillWives,"The STFU Method Let’s start with a little joke ripped right from /r/jokes top of all-time list…

A woman goes to the Doctor, worried about her husband 's temper.

The Doctor asks: ""What's the problem?

The woman says: ""Doctor, I don't know what to do. Every day my husband seems to lose his temper for no 
reason. It scares me.""

The Doctor says: ""I have a cure for that. When it seems that your husband is getting angry, just take a glass of 
water and start swishing it in your mouth. Just swish and swish but don't swallow it until he either leaves the room or calms down.”

Two weeks later the woman comes back to the doctor looking fresh and reborn.

The woman says: ""Doctor that was a brilliant idea! Every time my husband started losing it, I swished with water. I swished and swished, and he calmed right down! How does a glass of water do that?""

The Doctor says: ""The water itself does nothing. It's keeping your mouth shut that does the trick"".

**The STFU Method**

The STFU Method ^TM is a handy way to create and keep peace in your daily life. More specifically it will enable you to have a more loving relationship with your SO. We would like to examine why, how and when it is applied while also dispelling the misconception that you are a doormat for doing so.

*Why do I need to STFU?*

The art of listening is an invaluable skill that can be useful in all areas of your life. We listen to friends when they have trouble, kids when they want to show something off, our parents when they have some wisdom to share, and a variety of other times in our lives. How it is applied to your current romantic relationship is detrimental in the success/failure of it. I’m sure we can all agree that if you don’t listen, you can never fully understand. This is exactly why we stress  on RPW to just STFU. 

While communicating your wants, needs, and feelings is important, listening is often *more* important in the health and welfare of your relationship. Understanding what is actually going on vs what you feel makes it easier to know what the next step is. Reflexively responding to situations is only good in fight or flight situations. In the beginning of learning how to listen, it is good to just take all the data presented and digest it before actually forming an opinion about it. Over time, you will find that you instinctively can discern the appropriate behaviors for specific situations without ever needing to voice anything. In the beginning however, it is important to just S T F U. Listen. Learn. Absorb. 

For new relationships, it is easy to STFU. You want to know how the person acts, what they think, what they like, and you want to please them. This is great and wonderful. The trick is when you have been in a relationship and the honeymoon phase is over, how do you keep that ability to listen and desire to please going? You see this guy at his worst and you are expected to still take him seriously? *GASPS* Seriously though, complacency is the killer of romance. So how do you prevent this? By listening to your partner. When you listen to your partner you are actively working on your relationship. You cannot expect a relationship to survive with minimal effort on your part. It just won’t happen. 

*How do I STFU*

This might seem like a no-brainer. Just close your mouth and all will be well. It can be a little bit trickier than that. STFU also means body language. Eye rolling is not you STFU’ing. Gasping with exasperations is you not STFU’ing. Pouting is you not STFU’ing. 

STFU is you actively and consciously removing yourself from a situation to better assess it. For those who are more practiced, it could very well be only keeping your mouth closed. However, for most of us self proclaimed strong willed bull headed women we may have to *smile* and *say “ok my love”* and **walk away**. These three small actions can make a big difference in your communication style. 

The first step I suggest is to smile. This is probably the hardest step because you want to rip someones head off when they say something you don’t like but the more you do this the easier it’ll become. Fake it til you make it! The first few times, your SO might look at you like *WTF is wrong with her?* but over time it’ll just be a positive way to signal that you need some time to process the interaction you just had. You could give mean stank face but what is that going to accomplish? Who does that really hurt? You because you’re the one going to be stuck with the wrinkles. LOL. So smile and breathe in.

Next is to state something agreeable. “Yes, my love” or “ok, honey” both give a positive affirmation and also reminds your SO that you love them with a term of endearment. You acquiesce to the situation and you do so graciously. This is to preserve intimacy and the closeness of the relationship. When has being a bitch ever gotten you anywhere? Never!

Most important step here. Walk away. Go do what was told to you or just go to the other room. You can let your hamster tire out away from your SO. **DO NOT GO BACK UNTIL YOUR HAMSTER IS PANTING IN THE CORNER ALMOST DEAD FROM RACING AROUND.** Take this time to process what just happened. What was said, how was it said, what did you feel, why did you feel that way, what was your SO trying to say. All of these things are your hamster at work. You can use this as an exercise in reigning it in and over time you should be doing this faster and faster. This is also the time when you realize if you ACTUALLY do have something to say to your SO. This is when you can actually tell whether you should bring up something because it was detrimental on his part to the relationship. However, if that is the case, you still want to do it with a calm, cool and relaxed demeanor so taking time away is always a good idea. 

Those are just my three steps. Most times, I just need to close my eyes and take a deep breath and can handle most situations. However, these three steps have always been fundamental in my growth. When a breathe isn’t enough, I walk away. If you find that you are walking away alllll the time, then there may be deeper issues with yourself at hand and those should be examined too. 

*When do I STFU*

While reading this, you may think that STFU only applies when your SO says something to you that hurts your feelings. However, this applies to a variety of feelings. Not just hurt ones. When you aren’t getting your way, when you think you know better, when you want to control things, when you want to dominate things, when you want something done in a certain way, when you want something done now, when you don’t want to do something now, when you want to hamster, when you don’t want to have sex, when you feel bossed around, when things just aren’t getting done and you want them done NOW!!!! Etc etc etc. 

Bossing, nagging, whining, bitching, complaining, griping, mothering, smothering, gumbling, belly-aching are alllllll times when you need to STFU. At times these things can be masked as coming from a good place. A gentle reminder every 10 minutes to take out the trash. A little push in the right direction because he has no clue what he is doing. A honey-do list a mile long. Sound familiar? 

Now go and STFU! Please let me know if I forgot anything. ","I love this post. The ""yes my love"" or ""yes dear"" reminds me of Laura Doyle's ""whatever you think!"" which she says to use when your husband is trying to make you take charge of a decision but I think it works here too.",0

ermk46e,JustBeWhite,"I think everyone already knows this by now, but white worshipping is very profound in the black community as well. It's the reason why you see many black guys with 2-3/10 white women, if they date out. It's also the reason why you see an increasing number of black women dating out with white guys only. I say this as a black, darkerskinned woman. I too, have been passed up for white women by my crushes (they were both black guys). I even heard the sister of one of those guys say that he only likes blondes, lmfao. I grew to hate my dark skin. JBW is all powerfull for white women too, not just for men.","YES. This is exactly right. White people both men and women are seen as superior by all the others. JBW benefits white men and white women equally. I have seen Indian men with physically handicapped white women just due to 'white girl fever'. It's a global phenomenon not restricted to region or gender. Everyone is subconsciously programmed to seek out lighter/white skinned partners. How can you over come this? You can't. Your race determines how you are perceived. If I remember it correctly kerry Washington played a role in the tv sitcom scandal and her father had once quoted ""you have to work twice as hard to get half as much as a white person"". People deny racism and call poc sensitive but in reality no one wants to address the real facts of life: white supremacy will always be around.

Anyways why do you want a black man when you are a dark skinned black woman? Why put another dark skinned child in this world to suffer? If you do have urge to have a kid isn't it better to save up for a white sperm donor who can give you a caramel complexitioned kid? Wouldn't you be giving such a kid a better life than creating black children who will grow up to be insecure like you (Or anyone else on this sub really?).

2lhb7l,KotakuInAction,"I have to talk about the Gamerghazi thread regarding the brutal murder posted on 4chan. I'm sorry, but I have to get this off of my chest. I feel sick, physically ill. Full disclosure: I'm a fence-sitter. I regularly browse SA, 8Chan, GamerGhazi, KiA, because I like to see the entire picture. It has been an interesting read to say the least, and while I am not particularly passionate about the game jorno ethics stuff, it is interesting reading and stupid online drama is funny.

Today I came across a thread in Ghazi discussing the horrifying murder of a woman in her home. The killer then posted photographs to 4chan. There was no internet death threat, there was no mention of gamergate, there was just a fucking sociopath posting pics of his murdered girlfriend and gloating on it. Naturally the responses in the 4chan thread ranged from troll skepticism to abject horror/police calls.

I guess the reason I am shaking and have ice in my veins is the 89 comment discussion in Ghazi that came out of this.The line of thought became 4Chan=8Chan=Gamergate=Death Threats=Gamergate is a potential group of murderers aaaand this is why Ghazi is right! .......

They are literally blaming 8chan, KiA, and Gamergate for the death of a mother in front of her son. Sorry, but fuck you. I would downvote your shitty horrifying thread except you disabled downvotes. I would comment but I would get fucking banned for saying gamergate is not about causing domestic violence as it is a view that doesn't fit the narrative.

Sorry, but A WOMAN IS DEAD. IT HASNT EVEN BEEN 24 HOURS. A sick fuck with a history of domestic violence strangled his girlfriend to death.

All of them have been negative and so I tried to go get a blood test done but because of the current pandemic I wasn’t able to, leaving me uneasy about this entire situation. My period has always been regular every month but now that it’s gone I don’t know what to think about it. I have not worked out or changed my diet either. Has anyone else been through this? Is it possible to be pregnant with all these negative tests?","It is very unlikely but not impossible that you are pregnant.

There are many other causes of a period stopping in a previously menstruating woman. These can include polycystic ovarian syndrome, endocrine issues, stress, etc.

Your period stopping without explanation is a very good reason to talk to a doctor. Can you make a telemedicine appointment with your primary care physician? This should be doable, and while you won't be able to get the labs immediately, you can at least start the process of finding out what is going on. Make sure you disclose any other symptoms you have been having, even if you think they might be unrelated - headaches, vomiting, weight gain/loss, etc.

dbnj8st,Incel,"Speaking from experience, when you gain more muscles you gain more confidence. Just check out someone like Zyzz, he started out as an incel and ended up with girls all over him because the gym changed him and the way he acted. ","Speaking from experience, the confidence high you get is short lived and doesn't even begin to pay off in terms of effort you put in, which is why guys give up on lifting. Whatever you achieve becomes the new baseline and you need to get better and better to maintain the confidence boost. Zyzz needed it too, which is why he was on gear and probably why he's dead. He paid for that confidence boost with his life, that doesn't seem like a good deal to put in all that effort and lose everything.

And I don't know where you get the idea that it's his muscles that made him become an outgoing guy. He started working out pretty early (when he left school, which is like 16-17 in Australia), he was not an incel any more than any young guy is. If you Google pics of young Zyzz, you'll see him dressed outrageously at parties and with friends, doing the same shit he was doing later, except with his shirt on. He was a regular dudebro, a normie, he was not one of us and would never have been, regardless of muscles. His physique did make him more attractive, but muscles are more of a multiplier than anything. They will make attractive guys more attractive, but they will make short guys look shorter, ugly guys uglier, awkward guys look more awkward and if you're like a jacked guy in a wheelchair with atrophied legs, muscles will only make you look more lopsided. Think fake bolted on tits on a hideous woman, except an incel is not even a woman.

Finally, confidence is overrated. It looks like it works, and can occasionally fool people, but confident people are confident because of past successes (so confidence is more of a symptom than a cause of success). No one is confident their first time with a girl, and they still lose their v-cards despite that.

2fwjyf,marriedredpill,"Swallowed RP while wife is pregnant - looking for some input This may end up long, I think some background is necessary so bear with me and I appreciate all criticisms, feedback, suggestions, etc.  I feel like this is going to be RP on extra hard mode, what with balancing legitimate helping her with her pregnant needs, vs identifying true shit tests.


So I (36) swallowed the RP about a month or so ago, shortly after wife (35) of 7 years became pregnant with our first.  I found RP after we were talking about the ""spreadsheet husband"" with another couple and the husband admitted to me that his spreadsheet would look worse.  I also cringe at the dynamic him and his wife have (they have two kids under 4).  The one thing that just kills me is seeing her yell at him like he's done something wrong as her way of telling him to do something for the children as if he didn't read her mind and now she has to tell him a 5th time.


So I am on a mission to not end up like them, found RP, am reading up as much as I can.  I'm halfway through MMSL primer, finished No More Mr. Nice Guy, and read and absorb as much as I can from this and the TRP subs and sidebars.  Of course, started keto and lifting, eye contact with everybody, focusing on work and the projects I want to do for the house, and hanging out more with my own friends.


A little more background on my marriage.  She has a doctorate level education, makes about 2/3s what I do.  I am a partner with my brother in a small trade, with 5 employees.  She can be very stubborn, but after swallowing the pill, I've realized that she's given me a lot of both subtle and overt signs since the beginning that she deep down (and not so deep down) wants an RP marriage, but I know she'll still fight me every step of the way due to her stubborn nature, so this could all blow up, or it could be very rewarding, I've accepted outcome independence on this, but am optimistic.  

I came out of a 6 year extreme BP LTR - broken engagement at the end - BP'd her until she broke it off, didn't fight the breakup.  Became RP unknowingly afterwards, working on me, no girls for a year, focusing on starting the business, getting back into shape, etc.  So when I met the current wife I had plenty of RP attitudes going for me, and it's clear that's why she was attracted to me.  I had no money, it and my time were all tied up in building the business and she called our plan to specialize ""cockamamie"". 


Since getting engaged, of course, BP has been slowly creeping, but not at all to the level it was before, and I need to dial it back to where I was when we started at a the very least, or better.


Ok, specifics.


* Sex - tapered to average 1-2 times per week with a couple dry spells of 2-4 weeks at a time.  BJ's used to be often.  Only 4-5 times a year now  So not as bad as it could be, but I want to reverse and certainly not continue the downward trend.  Obviously there's no sex right now, she's got terrible morning sickness and she's terrified of miscarriage (we lost the first pregnancy).  I don't bring it up, and she will, of her own volition, apologize that she can't be very sexual but she's just so sick and she hopes I can understand.  She has given me a few HJ's mostly unprompted by me when she's been feeling a little better.


* Cooking - I am the cook of the household.  I worked in restaurants in HS and College and enjoy it.  She can't cook, but she likes to bake.  Currently she literally can't step foot in the kitchen without throwing up due to the smell sensitivity.  I've already laid out a strategy where she would help me spend 1-2 Sundays a month cooking a bunch of meals and meal components that we will freeze so that ultimately, she can transition to being able to prepare meals day to day.  I think I can easily do a chef/sous chef thing with this to parallel the Captain/FO dynamic as well.


* Cleaning - The kitchen is my domain, so I clean it.  I prefer not to for the most part, and I think I will at least even out that responsibility by insisting that plates are cleaned into the trash and loaded into the dishwasher by her.  She does laundry, 100%.  I may have to carry a heavy basket up/down the stairs for her from time to time because she is 5' 0"" and not very strong, but other than that, she takes care of it.  Also, we have a cleaning service that does the house once a month.  I take care of all the man responsibilities around the house - repairs, plumbing, mowing, putting in new hardwood, cabinetry, etc.


* Finances - we've been just kind of floating.  We started with nothing together, but make enough now, since she finsihed her schooling and started working and my business matured more, that we are no longer struggling, but we're certainly wasting plenty of money and not planning long term properly.  I've been pushing money into savings and keep a separate emergency fund that she doesn't know about either, but too much is still blowing right out the door mostly by her, but I was a little guilty myself.  That needs to change with the kid...before the kid.  She hates the idea of budgeting (especially tracking all transactions), but knows we need one.  A while back, before RP, I did sternly tell her that there is no other way than to track the transactions, and to go ahead and research it.  She did.  She now gets it but doesn't want to have to do it.  She's open to being given an allowance each week and letting me track everything.  The more difficult thing will be for her to accept that she can't just buy everything she wants to when she wants to.  I just switched from mint to YNAB and am going to button that down in the next week or so and see what happens.


Now to the ""fun"" stuff - Shit tests, Frame Holding (or not), dread, and legitimate screw ups.


The biggest BP invasion into our marriage has been me doing those favors for her that she could do herself.  Getting here drinks, snacks, grab her laptop, find her phone/ipad, whatever.  Always because ""she's had a hard day and needs to unwind in front of the TV"".  To transition this slowly (especially since she's pregnant and there are a lot of times now that she legitimately needs to sit still and try to eat small quantities of food to try to combat the morning sickness), I have simply been doing the things, but not without a proper ""please"" and ""thank you"".  I have, I imagine, pushed this over the line in the middle of a vomiting session when she needed something.  She's directly asked me what's up about it, and I say it's common manners, and how are we supposed to instill respect and manners in our child if it can't be achieved by us.  I have also gone cold on her a couple times when she would escalate into yelling or telling me to ""shut up"" by calmly replying with ""If you're going to be disrespectful, I will go do something else, I've got shit I need to get done"".  At one point a day or two after that she actually asked me ""what up with you wanting to be respected all of a sudden?""  I genuinely laughed like I heard a great joke and said nothing in response.  I think she realized how dumb that sounds coming out of her mouth.  That still solidified RP big time for me.  Although, I know she doesn't at all believe that I shouldn't have self respect and demand it from others, the very fact that those words came out certainly indicated that our BP ways, were bad enough.


A little dread?  Friday night, a former employee/friend of my brother and mine had a bachelor party at a nearby strip club.  Bro and I stopped by for about an hour.  Usually my wife gives me a BJ before hand to ""keep me honest"".  But of course can't this time and said that even though she didn't get to do her wifely duties before hand that I better honor the sanctity of our marriage.  I said (in my mind referencing the post about how men are the true romantics and more loyal, not to mention a big part of the whole red pill undertaking is for marital success) that I have more respect for our marriage than she would ever know, and told her she could make it up to me when she's feeling better and left.  I'm not big into strip clubs, I see right through the illusion, but having a few boobs rubbed in my face and practicing a little game with strippers and with some female patrons, was like getting a straight shot of testosterone.  Unfortunately, we were watching my brother's kids starting early the next day through Sunday, so didn't get to get any relief not self-supplied.   


So I think I had my first real shit-test, frame holding last night.  Let me know how you think this went.  We just got back from the OB/GYN getting an ultrasound, celebrating that this pregnancy is now further than the first one was.  After dinner she was looking though literature about classes and stuff and asking for my clarification on things that were confusing for her.  Then she's looking through a catalog of baby stuff and says ""there's a lot of stuff you need for a baby"".  To which I replied casually ""Those catalogs make you think you 'need' a lot more things that you do, so don't get too overwhelmed"".  She lost it.  Started freaking out about me being so negative and ruining her good experience.  How she was finally being optimistic about this pregnancy and I hurt her feelings.  The then said she hated me right now and threw all the literature on the floor, in multiple passes, as if to make a stronger point. 


I stayed calm, told her I didn't insult her, but maybe I insulted the catalog, and that I didn't ruin anything.  She was perfectly capable of staying optimistic and enjoying planning for the baby.  I forget the exact exchange, there was her demanding I apologize a few times, me refusing and explaining why I did nothing wrong but she said something along the lines of ""why have you been treating me like a child all of a sudden, with the  please and thank yous and now your being condescending about buying things for the baby"".  To which I promptly replied, ""is throwing a tantrum and pushing all your papers on the floor how an adult acts?""  I smiled, said ""you're over-reacting"" and grabbed her like we were ballroom dancing and started dancing with her and said, look, we can have a fine time tonight, you just have to let yourself.  So she then genuinely smiled got calm and said ""ok, I'll make amends, if you help me pick up the papers"".  


I held frame and said, you made the mess, you can clean it up.  She freaked out again, I quickly pointed out that she was throwing another tantrum like a 3 year old.  She said she hated me right now and told me to leave the room.  I didn't comply, I didn't say anything, except maybe, ""are you sure hate is the word you want to use""  she said ""extremely dislike you right now"".  She cleaned them up.  Calmed down a little and then opened up I feel like you want to buy all our kids stuff off craigslist (which I've never suggested, but I am value oriented, will spend good money on things that need to last.) and I want to be able to buy them nice things.   


I explained that there was an appropriate mix, and that certainly wasting money on superficial things at the sacrifice of the ability to have money available in case we really needed something for the kid.  She calmed down and went upstairs to the bedroom, I went to the basement to finish up a quick project for the house I had been working on.


I then went upstairs, took a shower, shaved, cleaned up my hair, and got into bed.  She came into the shower mad because I had taken the sonicare handle and was brushing in the shower when she wanted to brush her teeth.  I said she could have it when I was done.  She slammed the bathroom door.  I returned to the bed when I was finished.  She whined about the toothbrush a little and how I had it when she wanted it and also said that even though I brushed my breath still was bad (pregnancy nose, and keto breath don't mix).  Keeping it lighthearted I said, ""lets make a deal:  you go brush, I'll Listerine, we'll meet back here and I can kiss you the way I want to.


So we did, we reconvened, and I started kissing her.  She pulled back after a peck or two and I said let me really kiss you (not asking).  So we did make out a little, her pulling away a bit from time to time.  And then her saying my kissing was a little rapey and that I knew she couldn't have sex because she was terrified of miscarrying (unfounded I know, but she's not interested in taking any chances).  I said I just want to kiss my wife and nothing more.  (Inspired by MMSL 10 second kiss every day).  She said kind of angrily ""fine, I'll give you a handjob, that's what you want isn't it.""  She then grabbed me and went to town giving me an angry HJ (with lube, so not that angry).  I told her that's not why I was kissing her, but wasn't going to turn it down.  ""She said you made me angry, so this is what I'm doing""  She slapped my thighs a couple of times while she was doing it to ""let me know that she could be hitting my balls that way if I really pissed her off"".  I laughed, I came a little later.  She had grabbed some tissues to keep it clean, then washed up herself.  She was still acting angry, I'm not sure it was genuine.  She fell asleep.  When I said goodbye this morning.  I leave at 4:30, she's still in bed.  She asked sleepily if I was going to be late tonight.  We've talked today like normal.  So I think I can call that a success, but I'm not 100% certain if it could have been handled better.  


So although this is a lot of text, I think it's a good snapshot of where I am right now.  I would really appreciate any and all input you other married RP'ers can offer. What am I doing right?  What can I do better?  Where am I going wrong.  And most importantly what advice does anyone have for making this transition during a pregnancy?


Ideally, I'd like to learn and share my experiences and contribute my ongoing journey with this sub.

In the United States, anyone who makes a yearly income of $600 is subject to paying taxes by filing a 1099 form. OnlyFans will issue you these around tax time. These forms are provided to those who have earned self-employment income.  
  
When you earn self-employment income, it is important to start thinking like a business. As a business owner, you will need to file a tax return, but you now have the flexibility to choose how you want to get taxed, there are several taxing structures (Sole-Proprietor, Partnership, S-Corp and C-Corp) to consider that may offer better benefits and tax-saving opportunities to help you keep more of what you’ve earned. (Please consult with a CPA)  
  
As a business owner you are allowed to take ordinary and necessary expenses, such as new equipment, software/app subscriptions, prize/giveaways, costumes, and many more that will help lower the taxes you pay. A good way to do this is by opening up a separate bank account for your OnlyFans income and expenses, it not only helps with staying organized, but it provides strong documentation against possible audits.

d7lcuwo,Incel,"So... Just to be clear: you are bemoaning the fact that you are involuntarily celibate, and then in the same breathe you trash all the women who are out there having sex. I could see that coming from a place of jealousy (I.e. Others are getting laid but I'm not) but you don't even want to sleep with those women! You won't have sex with someone who isn't a virgin, that's not really involuntary. You could be having sex, but you have very specific criteria. So you hate that you aren't having sex, but you hate the women who are sexually available even more. Can you explain that? It doesn't compute, is it that you don't think women should have sex at all? Is it that they should only ever have sex with one person? And to reiterate if you choose to only sleep with virgins that is a choice you are making, it's not involuntary. How is that society's fault? I am genuinely curious, it's an odd trend in this sub. ","God fucking damn, how bad is your reading comprehension?

I said I wanted a virgin OR A CHASTE WOMAN.  EITHER WILL DO.  Damn, does caps make it easier for you to read?  Or are you so fucking mentally blind I need to bold it too?  Also I stated I want to start a family, not rail different virgins everyday.   I'm not greedy.

See, thats the problem with women.  They read some shit, completely misunderstand everything, and then assume/imagine how it read.  Its  like a filter that goes through their mind warping it into their hamster wheel reality.  Unreal.

I hate women because they are greedy.  I hate them because they don't contribute ANYTHING to society.  Birth isn't a contribution, females will do that in the wild regardless.  Males sacrifice their freedom of violence to build/maintain society.  Females sacrifice their freedom of sexuality to build/maintain society.  That was the ancient contract known as society and marriage.  It was fair.  It took players out of the game until everyone was a winner.  Now males still sacrifice their violence more than ever, males make all the contributions to science, inventions, and everything else.  80% of infrastructure workers are male.  If 30% of the male population decided to quit their jobs society would collapse.  If every single female quit her job we would survive.  Economy might take a small hit for a while but things would be okay.  So what the fuck do females contribute?  What the fuck do they sacrifice?  NOTHING in western societies.  Yet they have such huge egos &amp; attitudes.  Like they make the world spin and the universe revolves around them.  All because males are starved for sex they worship these fucking worthless pigs.  

Feminism was female's releasing of their IDs(subconscious darkness.)  If men as a whole ever decide to release their ID it would be hell on earth.  Rape, torture, and murder would be more common than saying hello.  Feminism is a hypocritical movement that does nothing but lie.  They want everything for females and nothing for males.  Women will never be equal to men.  No matter how many lies they tell.  Redpill continually rises, men are waking up to female nature.  Who knows what will happen.  But already we see men giving up on society.  Retreating to the fringes of society and doing bare minimum to survive.  Some go off the grid, some just work part time jobs for life.  Some men are leaving the country.  Fuck shitty anglosphere countries that shit on men endlessly.  And fuck a thousand times more the greedy cunts that leech of men like parasites.  Equality my ass.

Now sluts/chads trade each other like baseball cards and laugh their ass off at males who can't get any.  Genetics determine the sexual market value of every living human in this society.  But males and females sexuality does not work the same.  Almost all males will penetrate anything that moves.  Women are much more selective and always date up.  This current jungle law practice creates a class of sexless men.  About 20-30% of males are completely worthless to women genetically.  Women don't need them for money or marriage anymore.  

See, its not just me I'm concerned about.  I'm worried about my incel brothers who are not as picky as me.  Who can't even join in on western societies cesspool.  They have to get sex thrown in their faces on tv, internet, public, and even their phone apps.  Its fucking everywhere in our faces.  This group of people bragging about getting laid and how great sex is.  BUT YOU FUCKING INCELS CANT HAVE ANY, HAHA.  We're all going to have 50-300 partners for life.  BUT INCELS CAN'T EVEN HAVE ONE.  Society has become extremely toxic, greedy, and cancerous as fuck.  Many omega/beta/incel types feel they have nothing to live for or lose.  Thats why Elliot Rodger went nuts and started killing.  He wanted women, mostly white women.  But to those white women he was genetically trash so they never smiled at him, never gave a fuck about him.  So he rage killed people in a big ""Fuck you"" society statement.

So incels whether permanent or temporary are reduced to worker bees without any reward.  Women/chads tell us we are being selfish.  Yet they demand multiple partners.  Hypocrites.  They say they owe us nothing.  But then we owe them nothing.  Society can not survive without omegas/betas/incel types.  So why the fuck do they think they can shit on us?",1

6nsuxp,ActualWomen,"Transvaginal ultrasound ? I'm 26 and I went to the gynecologist for an exam and Pap smear. I've never had a pap and last time I had a pelvic exam was 10 years ago. My gyno was really nice and made me feel comfortable, considering. I indicated that I had been raped in the past by different men and that I have always experienced intercourse pain, even now with my current boyfriend who is nothing but gentle and understanding. I also cannot use a tampon. It has been worse in the past to the point that I could not even insert a tampon, but currently I am able to but experience pain and soreness inside and cannot stand to have it in for more that 15 minutes at best. 
When trying to have PiV sex, it is excruciatingly painful right as his penis enters. It takes a lot of patience and foreplay for him to enter entirely and even then, I usually experience pain deep inside. I am always sore afterwards. 
I've discussed all this with my doctor and she recommended pelvic floor therapy to help alleviate the pain I experience at the opening of the vagina during sex. She did not explain what this type of therapy involves. I have scheduled an appt already but I will probably cancel because it just seems too weird and invasive and I don't think I'm ready for that. 
For the pain I experience deep inside my vagina, she explained their could be scar tissue from past rapes. She recommends having a transvaginal ultrasound to figure out what the cause is. I read online it could also be other things like vaginal or ovarian cysts, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, etc. Apparently they use a hard plastic.. dildo-looking tool that is inserted into the vagina. And this is not performed by a doctor but just a normal ultrasound tech(!). This is really concerning to me and I am really afraid that this thing is going to hurt like hell. I realize this is a lot of rambling but I just don't have anyone to talk to about all this.. I haven't talked to anyone ever about my rapes and it is bringing up a lot of emotions on top of feeling embarrassed about how painful it is to have sex and feeling like there is something wrong with me. ):","They tried to give me when to confirm a PCOS diagnosis. I say tried, because we had to stop. I'm not great with medical procedures in general, but this one I apparently was making obvious pain faces and so the guy offered to stop.

Hard plastic dildo is accurate. The insertion itself I could have put up with, it's smooth and they lube it up, but then they have to move it around inside you, and the angling to press on my walls just hurt too much.

If they're trying to look at your ovaries, they might be able to do it through your stomach instead. Drink a TON of water beforehand. The tech said you want to basically be on the verge of peeing yourself in order to help them get a clear line of sight, and that if I don't pee before the procedure like I did that time, I may be able to avoid transvaginal ones in the future. So, ask if that's a possibility for what they're trying to look at. It might not be, but it's definitely worth the ask if you can avoid the other option.",0

Of course, there's myriad excuses to be made. ""Oh, they were just looking it up for morbid curiosity."" (As if a ""curiosity"" to watch young girls be raped is qualitatively different than a desire to.) And ""Indian men aren't rapists, they're just sexually repressed"" (the cure to sexual repression of course being more porn!). There's an entire conspiracy theory that she wasn't actually raped (which is completely untrue and has been proven so), including people saying it's impossible to rape an 8-year-old. Fucking really? 

Men will tell you that porn is no big deal, that the stuff *they* watch, the 'amateur,' paid-for, bespoke, gluten-free rimjobs, are exploitation-free. But then they open another tab and search for something like this. Porn sites obviously aren't very transparent with their data, but even the data they deem fit for release is telling.

Perhaps Americans has the highest perception of race than anyone in the World because we are a country made of immigrants and the original inhabitants of the continent.  You can read about this understanding in history, about understanding of ethnicity, national origins and race,  from the Irish and English men to the slave recently brought from Africa. In our times, a Black or Latino individual are very conscious about their race, and even white rural populations, and city people; however, the argument is on the interpretation of their behavior regarding other races which you are calling false understanding. You can not understand anything unless is part of your narrative, but you can understand your own narrative. Comparing current definition with the anthropological origins of men is quite distracting.

By virtue of the fact we all frequent this sub, we all share the similar mission of investing fully in our relationships and sharing as satisfying partnerships as possible. 

That being said, nobody is perfect all the time, and it would be naive to not expect challenges - especially over a lifetime. They say long-term commitment is valleys and hills, valleys and hills. I would think the goal would be as consistently happy as possible, rather than having unsustainably high highs and insanely low lows. 

For those of you who have experienced it, how have the highs and lows felt to you? Did you feel the lows were the product of reasonable unavoidability, or were they the consequence of errors? What piece of advice would you give on the matter of creating sustainable harmony?","We're going on 10 years and I can't speak for everyone, but I think the highs and lows become less common as time passes and you grow and mature together. Or maybe the highs become more common and sustainable and that is what makes it feel more harmonious. I don't know exactly- but I'm happier now than ever and I feel like I love my husband more with each passing year as crazy as that sounds. I love him now in ways I couldn't even fathom when we wed. I think putting him first was a big change as our marriage evolved. I used to be much more selfish and self-absorbed.. and typical of someone with those flaws, I didn't realize it. I'm far from perfect now, but I work to be a good wife and partner and I think putting the humble effort in definitely helps towards the goal of sustainable harmony. 

This isn't true for everyone, but I think for a lot of people with happy marriages, issues that could break a newer relationship early on become non-issues (or just tiny speed bumps) as the husband and wife learn to communicate better. From my own perspective, the lows are unavoidable when newly wed as you come across new challenges and face barriers, but I think the biggest issue (and this sounds silly) is just learning each others separate languages. We dated for many years before we married. I was arrogant and thought I knew my husband inside and out before we even said our vows. I didn't realize that at the time, but I'm quite sure that was the case in hindsight. Some issues took many years to even surface, let alone work out. Finances, sex, career choices, lifestyles, family planning.. these and other topics evolve over time. In my opinion, sustainable harmony ultimately comes from good communication with each other in a way each partner can understand. And sometimes that is the most difficult thing of all. &lt;3",0

A limited government is not a feasible long-term solution as governments naturally try to expand. Thus a lack of government (no centralization; self-government is okay) is necessary.

The free market is the best power-demolishing tool.","Giant behemoth corporations have sprung out of the free market, with massive amounts of power and control. This is quite the opposite of  the free market ""demolishing power."" Smart, savvy people in a free market can amass a LOT of power. And without a government to stop them from becoming a government, they will do exactly that. In the best case, this leads to a meritocracy. But - let a few generations pass, some crappy kids inherit the company-kingdom, and then boom. Tyranny. And then they start doing things to make the market less free, for their advantage.

If/when it gets to that point, your best hope is that leadership tanks the govo-corporation and creates room for someone better to take control. But power, even corrupt and inefficient power, naturally has an advantage once entrenched. The overlords are ""the devil you know,"" and it takes a lot to get people to revolt. And good, hardworking people in middle management and below often make up for the screw-ups at the top, sustaining the beast.

No one entity should be allowed to amass enough power to set or own the rules of play. So, how do you enforce that, while simultaneously keeping the market free(ish)? Nuke and pave every decade or so?",0
ciqmtvu,NationalSocialism,"USS Liberty was an accident of friendly fire. Israel admitted to that and paid restitution... long long time ago - 47 years ago.

USS liberty was the civilian cargo vessel Simmons Victory converted to carry electromagnetic audio-surveillance devices to spy on Israel during a time of war.

Next time, don't try to get close to spy on a country which is in the midst of a major war with its enemies.

Even Egypt which was at war with Israel then thinks so. Read it [here](http://www.egyptindependent.com/node/515763).

Anyway, the truth is ""*Both the Israeli and U.S. governments conducted inquiries and issued reports that concluded the attack was a mistake due to Israeli confusion about the identity of the USS Liberty.*

*In May 1968, the Israeli government paid US$3,323,500 as full payment to the families of the 34 men killed in the attack. In March 1969, Israel paid a further $3,566,457 in compensation to the men who had been wounded. On 18 December 1980, it agreed to pay $6 million as settlement for the U.S. claim of $7,644,146 for material damage to the Liberty itself.*

*On December 17, 1987, the issue was officially closed by the two governments through an exchange of diplomatic notes.*"" 

**This was the first and ONLY(!) incident, 47 years ago, where Israel killed (friendly fire) American Soldiers.**

If anyone think that today, 2014, or since this incident in 1967, that Israel is trying to kill Americans or hurt them, then they are delusional.

Israel is the best friend of the USA, more than Europe, Russia, China, South America, etc.

Better to concentrate on the real enemies of the USA instead of unexplained and irrational hate for Israel.

r7kfhx,RedPillWomen,"Is there a way to backtrack/restore balance after paying for and planning dates? I’m new here but I just found this community and it looks like a good place for a question that’s been on my mind. I (23F) have been dating my boyfriend (25M) for about 5 months now. When we first started dating, he was definitely making an effort to court me by planning dates but I tried to reciprocate and paid for some outings, meals, etc. He lost his job about 2 months ago and since then he hasn’t really planned or paid for anything that’s just the two of us. It’s not really about the money for me and obviously I know he’s currently unemployed, but it’s about the effort… it’s also about him letting me pay and kinda doing the halfhearted thing where you act like you’re about to get your card out but let the other one get it. I don’t really feel like he’s using me because he’s incredibly loving but it would also be amazing if he even offered something small like going out for a coffee date, visiting a museum, etc. There have been a few times where he had a date idea he never followed up on but I was hesitant to ask. I didn’t grow up in a family where we did things together much and financial problems were frequent so it’s hard for me to figure out how to navigate this.

I would like to talk to him overall about us planning more quality time together but would like to frame it so we’re both making an effort (not just me). Is there a way to approach this without coming across as overbearing? Or like a gold digger? I guess I don’t want him to take it like I’m asking for expensive dates again, I’m just asking for dates.

3nlkgp,marriedredpill,"Newbie with a quick question. Just found this sub a few months ago and it has blown my mind.  I can't believe I have gone through 36 years of life living such a shell of myself and being such a beta bitch.  I have read NMMNG, MMSLP, WISNIFG, MAP, and the book of Poon.  I have made every mistake there is to make.  

I have been slowly trying to digest all the information and not over compensate too quickly.  I have recently learned to STFU.  I used to just say whatever came to my mind and now am switching to controlled information.  This leads me to my question.  Today the wife, because of my new quiet self lost her cool and said "" You have been moody and won't say what's on your mind.  You are being such a chicken and not a man for not telling me what's on your mind.""   She then stormed off crying.  I tried to grab her wrist and was going to giver her a kiss on her forehead and tell her everything is okay, but she broke my grip and just went up stairs.  Before RP I would go and make sure she was okay.  Today I just went to the gym and then work.  This is the first reaction I have gotten from her since my minds eye has been awoke.  Is this a shit test or comfort test?  Did I play my card right by just going to the gym?

Thanks!","I would take that as her initiating sex.  Especially the calling you chicken and jibes at your manhood.  Tell her you have a one-track mind and you've been thinking about sex all the time lately.  

Could you follow her up to the bedroom or was her breaking the grip a ""hard no""?

Are you in a dead-bedroom situation?  To me, her coming over out of the blue and starting something and demanding to know what's on your mind means basically ""I'm bored, let's make out or have a fight.""

Leaving and going to the gym is probably a pretty decent default move if there was no way to turn her anger and frustration into sexual arousal.",0

If accuracy is your concern, shouldn’t you be celebrating the use of the inclusive and exclusive language of the brand Contra explores, as regards medical publication?  A variety of diseases and conditions can prevent cis women from menstruating.  In regards to menstrual health advocacy, the term “menstruators” is the **most concise and accurate term available**, so if exacting accuracy is more important than feelings then “pregnant person” is acceptable and “menstruators” is particularly efficient.

I consider myself gender-critical and a feminist. I agree with a lot of what I read here. But I don’t understand the negative attitude I sometimes see about the word “queer.” Can someone explain?

I’ve identified as “queer” for a long time. I am a woman who loves women. But I also occasionally like some dick, so I have never considered myself a “lesbian.” And “bisexual” doesn’t feel right to me either. I don’t want a boyfriend, and I don’t have any romantic feelings for men. I’ve always thought of “bisexual” as speaking to not just the kind of sex a person likes but also the kind of love and partnership a person likes. And in that sense, I am not bisexual. I could say I’m a lesbian who, when I’m single, sometimes enjoys a bit of sex with men on the side — but that’s not a lesbian. So, although it rarely comes up since I don’t consider my bedroom activities a topic for public conversation, I’ve gone with “queer.”

If there is anarchy it is sponsored by the direct and deliberate action of Russia's military.  The leaders of the ""rebels"" all happen to be active duty officers of Russia's special forces.  Doesn't that tell us anything?

No, I don't think Putin directly ordered the shooting down of the airliner.  But he has ordered all the actions that created this situation, and is directly responsible for the airliner.  If he is not held to account for this event he will be emboldened, and he will take Western meekness as a green light to escalate further.

It is indeed unwise to mock Putin's pride and paranoia.  It is equally unwise to appear weak in the face of his aggression and belligerence.  When a Russian bully confronts you, either you stand your ground, or you get your face rubbed in the asphalt.  There is no other response possible.","&gt; But he has ordered all the actions that created this situation

I think it's beyond any doubt. Everyone knows that nothing like this happens close to Russian borders without Putins personal approval. If he seriously didn't want any such conflict he'd ordered the Russian military in to Ukraine to help the Ukrainian defence forces to remove the rebels.

Ukraine also isn't some complete banana republic where you can buy AKs of a corner store, so the weapons, uniforms and other gear have to have come from somewhere and Ukraine sure the hell isn't providing them.

cjyl0w6,fPUA,"I disagree. 

- On one hand, I've had plenty of guy friends I've pursued (and yes, that counts as ""not having many options""). While I did not end up in a relationship with any of them, I have not *lost* any friendships because of just that, because I put the onus on *myself* to get over liking them so that we could return as friends (and it works). In some cases, the friendship became even stronger afterwards.

- Having options can also screw things up. Just last week, I felt compelled to confess to a guy I was on a second date with (whom I grew to like) that there was also another guy I was interested in and so I needed time to think about it. Upon hearing that, he promptly ended things that night. (Rookie mistake, I know.) I was distraught for the next few days and realized I really wasn't interested in the other guy. I still don't know if things can be patched (I'll be talking to him again sometime next week) but having options can hurt you if you aren't careful about how you handle them.

I will, however, say this: Make sure you have something else that keeps you from devoting all of your time and energy into one person.  Don't spend all your time waiting for his texts, calls, and chats, don't spend all your time daydreaming about dates with him. Instead, keep yourself busy, whether it's with school, work, hanging out with friends, even hanging out/dates with other guys if you can manage it - anything you can throw yourself into so that you're not always hovering by your phone and computer waiting to hear back because at that point, I'm pretty sure guys smell ""too-available"". Plus, it's not good for your productivity.","&gt; While I did not end up in a relationship with any of them, I have not lost any friendships because of just that

Sure, it's *possible* to keep the friendship. My point is that you can't guarantee that you'll keep it and you need to be okay with the risk you're running.

&gt;Having options can also screw things up. Just last week, I felt compelled to confess to a guy I was on a second date with (whom I grew to like) that there was also another guy I was interested in and so I needed time to think about it.

dn7kg9s,Gender_Critical,"I relate so much to everything you've said, OP.  I could have written this myself when I was a teen.  My suggestion to you is to use binders.  When I was a teenager, I had a period of several years where I hated my breasts.  I hated the way they looked and what they represent.  For me, as I grew more confident in my self and my body, I came to accept and appreciate my breasts as a part of me. Being a woman didn't mean much to me as a teen either.   Only now that I'm older and I have a greater understanding of feminism and women's struggles do I take pride in being a woman.  You will probably always have parts of your body that you don't like, and would change if you could, but that doesn't mean you should change them, or that you're any less of a woman.  

In my opinion, you aren't trans, but rather struggling with the rapid changes of your body.  You have an image of yourself and your body that you've had since you were a child, and breasts aren't a part of that.  I think in time you will become more comfortable with your adult body and while you may never want to show them off in push up bras or low-cut shirts, your breasts will start to feel as much a part of you as your ribs or your nose.  
","I strongly discourage the use of binders. They've been shown to cause multiple health issues: permanent deformation of the breasts, breathing problems (can't get enough oxygen), permanent changes in posture (due to spine compression) and the formation of the rib cage, lack of blood flow, fractured ribs. 

There is no safe way to bind. Trying to cover up discomfort or disgust you have with your body by  wrapping it up so tightly will cause permanent damage. ",0

In the case of a gay couple (and lets please not get into semantics over FTMs being in a straight or gay relationship) they could want their own kids as well. So it could be that an FTM in some cases does it so they have genetically related kids. In cases with a trans man and woman, could maybe be the woman has issues with carrying child.

I can see a few reasons why a trans man might do it if possible, and it could simply be the desire to have kids that are related to them is stronger then the dysphoria they have over having a womb. Basically, even if they don't like it they might use it to have a family...which considering how in America it can be difficult for LGBT parents to adopt, I can easily see some feeling this is the better and easier option even with their dysphoria.",This is a very good guess.

Claims that the driver is claiming not to have acted maliciously but was attacked and acted out of fear.

Also claims that the car was attacked by people with bats.

This is the best video I could find.

Warning NSFW Video:

At 30 seconds the car plows into the crowd. Followed by protesters carrying baseball bats.

Here is two protestres clearly shown in the picture here.

&gt;http://i.imgur.com/hrJS8fP.jpg

Here is a third man with a bat here chasing the car as it begins to back up:

&gt;http://i.imgur.com/hrJS8fP.jpg

Here is a fourth individual carrying a stick and swinging it at the car:

&gt;http://i.imgur.com/hmtUYDH.jpg

These people show up to the scene behind the car while chasing it. These people were armed and the claim is that he was attacked by protesters with bats before attempting to flee.

Some of the individuals who were hit are clearly the ones with weapons attacking the vehicle.

I'll update with more once I can see it. But this would go along with The Hill reporter's tweets regarding the car being attacked with baseball bats.

EDIT: Here's a shot from another angle showing someone swinging a bat at the vehicle before he hits someone:

&gt;http://i.imgur.com/QhtIKh7.jpg

Source:

&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzpQEQZNLng

The car is clearly traveling slow enough for this bystander to step out into the road and swing the bat and making contact with his vehicle. This car was not traveling at a high rate of speed prior to hitting the crowd.

You can hear the engine begin to rev and the car speeds up once the car is hit with the baseball bat the contact is loud enough to be heard by the camera in the video from more than 50 yards away. Prior to this noone is panicked and there's no signal from the camera man or anyone on the side of the road that this person has already struck anyone or intended to. 

Notice the car has no intention of hitting the man with the camera or on the bike passing by and also did not continue to hit anyone on the way out. Generally mass murderers are there to cause as much damage to people as possible.

Also there is no reports of a car chase or an attempt to resist officers or flee arrest. The only image we have is one of him sitting on the ground with his hands out. Generally not the MO of these types of car attackers or generally any terrorist or mass murderer.","Terry McAuliffe has blood on his hands, one thing u can notice on the video is that there is no cop to bee seen, they left the antifa lose and focused only on these 'evil Nazis'.",1

Most water beetles can only live in fresh water, with a few marine species that live in the intertidal zone or littoral zone. There are approximately 2000 species of true water beetles native to lands throughout the world.

Many water beetles carry an air bubble, called the elytra cavity, underneath their abdomens, which provides an air supply, and prevents water from getting into the spiracles. Others have the surface of their exoskeleton modified to form a plastron, or ""physical gill"", which permits direct gas exchange with the water. Some families of water beetles have fringed hind legs adapted for swimming, but most do not. Most families of water beetles have larvae that are also aquatic; many have aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults.",Haha nice one kid didn't summer end already? ,0

cnmbegd,marriedredpill,"My Mum started taking anti depressants to help with her menopausal symptoms and is completely different. 

Before, she was loud, highly strung, controlling, extremely moody, and generally a bitch to my Dad who she had under her thumb. 

Now, she is much more relaxed, easy going, nothing really bothers her, she can't be bothered to gossip, and I rarely notice mood swings and she is a little more placid and overall more pleasant for everyone (including my Dad) to be around.

But at the same time, now she can no longer be bothered to cook, clean, or do anything really interesting with her family. She would rather go out with her friends dancing and drinking and having ladies' weekends away. She almost has a teenage kind of vibe about her now, which I don't agree with at all for a 50 year old woman. 

If I were my Dad and my wife was acting the way my Mum was and is now acting, she'd be hearing about it either way. But, if you have a generally good SO who isn't quite 'difficult' before deciding to take meds, you might be in luck.

kouqxp,TGandSissyRecovery,"Tips to help with insecurities I’ve talked with a lot of people both in this sub and outside of it that struggle with body image issues. It’s one of the main factors pushing a lot of us towards this fetish, and is one of the first things you should be targeting when trying to get out. I’ve told a few people about a technique that I used that helped me a lot, and I figure I might as well make a post about it. Since most of you view yourselves as straight men, regardless of any attraction to men you might have, it’s an important look on why you shouldn’t be as insecure. What you need to do is think about as many girls you have ever liked in your life that you can remember. For each, think about things you didn’t like about her, be it appearance or behavior. If you believe a girl you used to like is “perfect”, dig deeper and force yourself to admit at least 1 flaw, everyone has at least 1. After this, acknowledge how many flaws were in these girls, and remember how much you liked them despite this. Maybe you liked her better because she was imperfect, or maybe you ignored them to like her. Either way, once you’re done, specify with yourself what exactly you don’t like about yourself. A lot of common ones are probably going to be weight, height, penis size, facial appearance, and possibly other things like acne or scarring. At this point there are 2 final steps, first think about the girl with the most imperfections that you still liked. Don’t worry about how many you have thought about yourself, but realize that you find yourself to be straight. If you could overlook everything that was wrong with her, why would you think you couldn’t find a girl that could overlook what you find wrong with yourself, and especially if you were one of those that found yourself liking her imperfections (I know I was), that likely means there’s a girl out there that will like yours. The second of the 2 and final step is to separate everything you don’t like about yourself into 2 categories. The first is things you can change, and the second is things you can’t. For things that can change it will be a case to case basis. Some people have acne that could be cured by regularly cleaning the skin that most often gets it, while others have tried everything they could to get rid of it but still can’t. If you can’t think of how to fix a part but know it can be fixable (especially with acne) I recommend either searching online for fixes (there are a lot of medications and diet tips online for how to deal with it), or going to a doctor (dermatologist) to determine the best strategy going forward. Weight is likely another common factor that is changeable, and what I recommend most is trying to work out in a public gym. It helps you both lose the weight, and realize how little it is actually noticed by the average person. If you aren’t comfortable going, or if you have a bad experience going, I’d do home workouts multiple times a week, but force yourself to go to some public workout, whether it’s a gym or just going for a walk, jog, or even run in a public area. As for things you can’t change, I will likely be of even less help. I tried the strategy where you write them down on a piece of paper and then destroy the paper, which is supposed to help you let them go. It didn’t really work out of me, and I had to just do a lot of self meditation to begin to accept my insecurities. It will likely be a different process to accept them for everybody, but the main steps are the same. Recognizing that everybody, even the people you cared about most, have flaws is important. And, it is equally important to learn to accept that you can never be perfect, but that’s fine because no one is. Your only goal should be to be as close to perfect as possible in ways you can control, and accept the things you cannot.","Welcome to TGandSissyRecovery.

dbl8qzm,whitebeauty,"What about half white women? What about Jewish women with white skin? Are you averaging every white women's attractiveness and comparing it to the average of all non white women?

However, this blog, and a lot of men's right's supporters fail to acknowledge that the systems of power (legislature, courts, etc) that enshrine ideas and beliefs into laws granting rights and materially affecting people's lives, were until the 20th century firmly and undeniably in the hands of men.  That doesn't mean that I don't feel sorry about men oppressed under this system, but it does mean that it irritates me to hear people claim that it is or was harder to be a responsible man than a dependent women.  I know there were and are a lot of women who were and are better off than a lot of men, but I also know that men generally had more options and freedom of choices than women did.  Thankfully that is no longer the case.

Nevertheless, even today, women are underrepresented in government: they represent 50.8% of the population, but there has never been a female president in the US, where women make up only 17% of congress members, 25% of district judges, and only 3 of the 9 supreme court justices [google it].

I do not think these statistics represent any inherent ""female"" traits and would like to see more young girls encouraged to get off of their asses and do some meaningful work: I truly believe this would be in the benefit of males as well as females.  ","Have you read ""The Myth of Male Power?"" If you have then I suggest you look back over it. 

Patriarchy is a biased theory that completely ignroes the survivalistic aspects of human history, as well as the technological breakthroughs that are the saving grace of female biological restrictions throughout history. If this is something that you disagree with then I will have to bow out of any further discussion given that patriarchy is a conspiracy theory given weight by ideologues who want to cause social warfare.",1

htxcdx,TGandSissyRecovery,"COMPLEX SITUATION [SINCERE APOLOGIES IF RULES ARE BROKEN!] my dilemma is confusing, so to make this simple, trans porn is not interesting. anything that has two penises is met with instant rejection, visceral doesn’t even cover it. if i see so much as a man’s head as i scroll or two trans penises, i look the other way. if it’s T-on-F, it’s alright. not worth my time. not a fan

*but*

traps &amp; *feminine* “crossdressers” are interesting. this i will say, never publicly. for example, when i see a “trap” or a “crossdresser” cum from anal, i can’t help but get a little turned on. tested the attraction with femboys &amp; out of the sub i’ve seen &amp; other sites, (nothing gay porn-related) like .001% are nice to look at. it’s weird. i prefer *solo* traps &amp; CDs, *never* other porn genres. i even DMed an insanely hot CD &amp; she (he? this person is pre-op &amp; not HRT) wuz very sweet &amp; fun to talk to, flirty too, but could b part of the job. we’ve talked back &amp; forth a number of times. she says she’s scared to walk alone where she lives (can understand) 

what is this? my ex (a woman with a vagina) &amp; I went on VayKay &amp; our waitress was trans. hard to tell at 1st, but once i took a closer look, i mentally said “oh.” as we left, i mentioned it to my ex, who is left-LGBT (i’m not) &amp; she said “i can understand that.” her ass was nice, she was cute in the face, very cute actually, but the thought of being presented with a penis is a little weird. i’ve *thought* about “messing around” &amp; messaging trans women (with the clearest intentions) but i know i’ll regret it. i’ll consider myself a failure as I’m not bad looking &amp; love women. 

but it gets worse as i think there’s two conflicting desires here: novelty &amp; *experiencing novelty itself.* i’m high-energy &amp; i don’t actually masturbate to what i look at. just curious. but i don’t even know. it doesn’t bother me in the sense of a breakdown or being suicidal (god bless you all on your journey btw) but i dig it, even if i tell myself i don’t.

am i Bi? or is this lingering porn addiction? i exclusively watch JOI &amp; male-on-female is extremely gross. haven’t watched it in years. revolting &amp; i refuse to see a man pound a woman. not a turn-on.

cs8jsbx,marriedredpill,"Keeping a secret for nine years is not being faithful. It's daily bald faced lieing by omission, so no, she shouldn't be getting ""credit"". With cheating, many people would say the sex isn't half as bad as the deception and lies that are pure and unadulterated selfishness.

There were plenty of opportunities where a person of conscience would have spoken up. Like when the man she betrayed proposed marriage, out when she stood in front of God and family to take vows. To give credit for nine years of good behavior without taking into account the daily lies is ridiculous one-itis (not by OP).","Fair point.  Especially when he proposed.  That isn't a secret that should have been allowed past that.  She should have come clean then.  And it sounds like OP did take all of this into account.

But it sounds like this secret was a burden, and as others have mentioned before, BP TrainingTheBrain would have flipped his shit and gone crazy if she told him.  New, stoic TrainingTheBrain gave her the oak she needed to finally get this off her chest.

5ecnie,RedPillWives,"[FR] ""I'm sorry. I was wrong."" I'm fairly new to surrendering and thought I was doing well until I fell off the wagon last night.  

I was waiting for my husband to come join me to bed and he said he needed 2 more minutes to finish an update on this computer.  About 15 minutes pass and I hear him laughing at something from down in the man cave.  I assume he's just browsing the internet and found something funny, so I yell, ""So much for 2 minutes!""

I immediately regret it as he stomps up the stairs, defending himself about how he was almost done, his friend just sent him a funny picture, why do I have to get on his case, etc.

My first instinct was to defend myself and attack him for ""always"" keeping me waiting.  But I stopped myself and said: ""I'm sorry.  I was wrong.""

There was awkward silence for a moment, as if he had already been preparing his retort to my attack, but was blindsided by my apology.  He actually looked at me like I had two heads, and I couldn't help but wonder, *Am I actually that much of a bitch normally?*

So although this story started with a fuck up, I'm grateful for the bit of newfound self-awareness and the fact that I was able to minimize what would have, in the past, been an hour long fight that would've ended with us going to bed pissed off instead of having sex and cuddling.","This is great!!!

35nsdt,asktrp,"Been trying to swallow TRP for a while, today is that day, help? **Quick introduction/backstory**

I am 18 and realised I have been doing everything wrong regarding relationships. Full on beta. Just to prove how beta I am I will explain, my ex-girlfriend broke up with me nearly 10 months ago and have been sobbing since. Pictures of her still everywhere, clothes still hanging up in my closet, etc. You get the point.

A good 8 months ago I first bumped into TRP and got mad to be honest, you guys looked like the dumbasses. The people I was taught to dislike. Now I am beginning to understand and want to become a better version of myself.

**When I realised I needed to swallow TRP**

To be fair, I thought I had it all figured out. Thought I was pretty good at getting girls. Not. 

I told myself I'd stop having an exclusive relationship and just have plates I think they call it here.

Last week I started, found a girl chatted her up and got her number. We've been texting extensively and we came to an agreement where we'd be fwb, right? This sounds like a pretty good thing? It isn't. Quickly I learned this is more than just fwb to her. We text all day, I'm basically her boyfriend I feel like, only difference being I can leave whenever I want with supposedly not hurting her feelings.

**What to do from here?**

I read some of the main TRP guides and set up some goals for myself. These are due the end of the summer.

* 20 phone numbers 
* Sexual relationship with atleast one girl
* Get over my Approach Anxiety

Now, what are some of the things you'd say to me before I'd start this journey?



**note:** I have set goals quite low and haven't given it too much taught really, if you have any suggestions please, do.




","1. Read the sidebar on the main sub. 
2. Then read all of that again. 
3. Read the PDF with collected best posts. 
4. Keep reading.

Bring down the frequency of texting with your plate/gf. Start going out with other girls. Don't talk about it with her, but keep to the agreement of being FWBs. Let her make up her own mind whether she still wants that arrangement or not. 

Start doing other things for yourself: lifting, hobbies. At this point working on self-improvement is more important than anything else. Don't focus too much on girls and getting laid. That will come. ",0
cc0zqq,MoreTankieChapo,"Questions I've been reading Marx and learning about dialectics and I think I've gotten a decent enough grasp on stuff like Materialism and Idealism, and i think I can see where you're coming from but some questions, I get this might just be a meme sub but I'll ask anyway

Stalin seems to be a diversion from Lenin, forced collectivization seemed different than previous policy, Socialism in One country doesn't seem to follow Lenin's more internationalist bent, he seems like a complicated figure especially as positions changed over time too? Is Stalinism just MLism or is there a divergence? 

Why would you say the Soviet Union failed?

hffv5b4,Egalitarianism,"If the purpose of patriarchy theory is just to find the root cause, and said root cause is gender roles as you have ascertained in your comments. Then wouldn’t that make patriarchy theory obsolete right now (since they mentioned nothing about focusing on finding solutions, but just finding out the root cause for the ‘patriarchy’). And if they are looking for solutions, why is there still so much obsession with ‘patriarchy’ instead of ‘gender roles’. 

I think it is just that many feminists use the term patriarchy differently, so it feels impossible to define what is it they are trying to say sometimes.","Hi, Mysterious asked me to come and reply directly; broadly speaking you are right that ""gender roles"" are the root cause, but which gender roles? How? Why?

The issue of inequality of power is encapsulated in the term patriarchy, so it's useful to continue to discuss the issue as we attempt to nail down what it is about gender roles which contribute to this discrepancy, and how. Keep in mind that biology undoubtedly plays a role too!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I think it is just that many feminists use the term patriarchy differently, so it feels impossible to define what is it they are trying to say sometimes.

I think there can be some confusion about what the patriarchy is vs what implications that has. The definition of patriarchy is solid, you can check Oxford Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, Geek Feminism, Wiki, etc, it's all the same. 

What is not in agreement is what this means for society and what contributes to the patriarchy.

* Has a career and/or proud of his work (not just a dead-end job with no aspirations of bettering himself)
* Lives on his own or is actively working towards that goal.  I understand that it's very common (and a good idea!) these days to live with family or roommates in early 20's to save money.  But independence and self-sufficiency are important traits.
* Plans &amp; pays for the first date.  However, I would also be wary of a man who spends lavishly on the first date.  Shows that he may not be financially responsible (even if he's well paid), or trying too hard to impress you and get something out of you.
* Honest and upfront with his intentions.  Lets you know what he thinks of you and where he wants the relationship to go early on (AKA not you asking the ""what are we?"" question).

These types of accounts are really common in that sub and it's related subs. Seriously, go look through their top of the month and really look at the accounts posting everything. The amount of accounts that are 2,3,4, etc years old with no post history before a month ago, with 24/7 posts (as if it's run by a team rather than a person), all political, is insane.

dc1zbw3,DebateFascism,"I was originally a communist, but became a fascist after further reading into the socialist political system. 

I hold by its dislike for capitalism, but I cannot see a system of economics working wherein everybody is paid equally, which leads to the food shortages and poor quality goods that were produced in the Soviet Union, and other communist countries, as well as a shortage of people willing to perform difficult tasks e.g brain surgery. From there, I concluded that a mix of capitalist and socialist philosphies were needed - one to direct the market as effectively as possible, as well one to ensure the workers are treated fairly.

Another key flaw for me in communism was its social stance. I do not support the LGBT movement, I do not believe that minorities need to be treated specially through affirmative action, I do not feel that everybody is unique, and I can not hold the viewpoint that everybody is equal. That cannot hold true when you compare a disabled person to a brain surgeon - one has a clear value to society. These views, however, are completely the opposite in the socialist movement, at least from the common demographic I've observed, and I've since become alienated as a result.

With those two things in mind, leaning left economically but going far off to the right socially, I believe that something like Strasserism, or something similar to Fascist Italy is the best fit for me politically.

EDIT: I must also mention the emphasis on discipline in youth, keeping an orderly society in place, valuing interventionist foreign policy for state security, and maintaining an authoritarian state of government, as other factors for me becoming a fascist. The only thing I'm unsure on is totalitarianism, in which my concerns about the people only relate to the public, not the private life of individuals, barring a few exceptions (i.e drugs, child abuse, pedophilia, etc). I do not see a need for a government to have total control over the people.","Are you new here?

","&gt;Candito's programming is known to be pretty sub-par for bench.

When I picked Canditio, I did a fair amount of research and looked at a whole host of programs. I picked this one  because I liked the format and the way it could be personalised and also his attitude towards lifting - he very much advocates training to lift without injury as opposed to lifting to limits / overload / injury. 

But I did read that about his bench -  he acknowledges that too and wrote his bench periodisation program for that reason. So I'll keep at it for the moment - switch to the periodisation program (^ weeks) if needs be  - and see if I can break through this plateau. 

It could - as you say - be a form problem too. I may need to look at that. It could also be a food issue. I may need to just start eating more.

fwkvblz,SocialJusticeInAction,"Being trans is a result of a choice, being intersex is a biological result.","&gt;Being trans is a result of a choice

But if you have gender dysphoria the typical choice is between commit to suicide and transition. Also there is no effective reparation therapy. And, there are evidences that gender dysphoria is biological result.

A lot of researches show that typical MtF has female finger ratio index:

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16140461/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16140461/)

It means that hormones level when pregnant changes a brain. Also we have thease researches: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180524112351.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180524112351.htm)

And about AGP, cis-women are AGP too: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19591032/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19591032/)

And you know it. It's pretty normal for all female to go to the mirror, change look, and be happy if you're look is good enough.

It's  same for TG girls: in the female level of tostesteron/estrogen we're  usually not really sexual attracted to ourselfs, even if we're bisexual  or lesbian, we just want to have nice look and be happy about it.

So,  gender is biologically determinated. Yes, partly it's social contract.  It's bio-social construct: bio basis, basement, and than social  contructions above.

Also there are  researches that TG girls has libido level below cis-girls:

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24165564/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24165564/)

So,  we can't be rapist more often, than cis women. There are a lot of reports  about home aggression in the cis-lesbi families - IT ~~never~~ CAN HAPPEN (and  more often than in case of TG girls)

zoej3o,ForeverAloneDating,"27 [M4F] UK/Europe- Software dev and houseplant addict. Looking for new platonic connections and good conversation, but open to more for the right person! 🌱 Hey there!

I’ve posted on here a few times in the past, and figured I’d give this a try again as I’m looking to meet some new people!

I’m posting here again, as while I think I’ve got my life pretty together, I’ve neglected my social life recently. I have a number of friends IRL, but we’ve become distant as of late due to everyone being in different stages of their life, meaning a lot of my social life revolves around work.

It’d be lovely to have a deeper connection with someone. I consider myself decent in conversation, empathetic, emotionally intelligent, and I love speaking to people from all walks of life :)


**A bit about me!**

I'm 27 from the UK and have been working as a software developer for the last 8 1/2 years. As you would expect, my primary interest is around computers / tech! Over the last few years, I've tried to branch out and find new interests, as I don't want that one passion to consume my entire identity.

Currently, my biggest interest is houseplants. Having gone from complete novice in 2020, to now caring for over 50 (it's turned into quite the addiction!). I'm also really into interior design (particularly mid-century) and love learning about all of the iconic pieces and the designers who created them.

I love photography, but haven’t picked up a camera in far too long. I’m also collect vinyl, and I’m a big fan of F1.

I’m in the process of getting an Autism / ADHD diagnosis, as I’ve noticed my interests tend to change all the time, so if you’re ND, we’ll probably get on well!

I’ve recently got back into reading / podcasts again. I tend to read non-fiction on topics such as AI, neuroscience, InfoSec, and cybercrime. (Don’t get me started on these topics, as I’ll speak for hours and you’ll soon regret it!)

Currently, I’m reading a book about unconscious bias, something that unfortunately is very prevalent within the tech industry. I’d love to get more into fiction though, so suggestions are always welcome!


It would be really nice to have someone to message throughout the day, send cat spam to, and just have good conversation. If it leads to voice chat / meeting IRL / something more, then that’s cool too, but an actual connection is most important to be first and foremost, so let’s  take things slow.

All I ask is that you’re around the same age and preferably from the UK/within Europe, and take the time to write a bit about yourself when you message!

If it matters, I’m 5’10, slim, and half British / Pakistani, with long brown hair and eyes. Happy to send pictures if you wish, but it’s not something I deem that important in the early stages at least, so I won’t be asking you for any!

Have a good one, and hopefully speak soon ✌️","Thank you for posting, /u/epochh95. Please know that your thread has been locked, as all posts on this sub are.

That's sad, delusional and SO narcissistic. But hey, it could be worse. At least the spouse isn't so high on trans and narcissism, that they'd ever say it to the kids face, right?


*She has said that jokingly a few times, even to their faces*


FUCK!

Transwoman stays at home because the world is such a dangerous place, plops down the kid in front of the TV, and ignores it the rest of her day, while she fights TERFs and talks makeup online.

iwzli8,askAGP,"The story of the mess that is my gender/sexuality Hi all,

I lost some sleep over this last night so I want to document my thoughts here and see if I can gain anymore insight. I'm going to try keeping this short but that's not gonna happen.

I've been hung up on gender issues on and off for years and I have gotten more consumed as the years have gone by. I used to put off solving this problem but as I have gotten older I realized I needed to make a decision to either commit to transition or risk getting stuck as a regretful nonpasser later in life.

I am posting here because AGP is a totally self extinguishing and invalidating idea to most trans people so it's not really accepted in those circles. I think most people in my position just decide they want to transition so they must be trans. They become convinced they are truly female inside and they move forward without getting stuck like me. I wish that was me but it's not. I obsessively analyze everything and it causes me a lot of distress at times.

I feel like I had a small breakthrough last night and gained some insight into my desires.

First of all what I'm not sexually attracted to: genitals of either sex. Sex - I don't want to penetrate anyone tho being on the receiving end does have some appeal to me. I don't like porn that depicts sex as I find it too graphic for me. I am not attracted to masculinity/guys at all though I do occasionally see the appeal of meta attraction.

I have four main sexual triggers which all work together to drive me to want to transition: I find it hot to be helpless, I want to feel desirable to others, I want to be desirable to myself (AGP), I think I also have some gynephillic attraction to feminine people other than myself (I kinda find women hot).

Due to probably some internalized misogyny I connect being a woman with being helpless so to fulfill my helplessness kink I want to be more feminine. I'm also into bondage for the same reason I think - it's a loss of power that makes me feel helpless.

I want to feel desirable to others like every other human does. It is hot to feel desirable to others. I think I would be/am more desirable in female form so I want to transition. How do ""normal"" guys deal with this? Most guys are pretty physically undesirable to everyone right? How do they not hate themselves for it?

I am self attracted as well. Since I am only attracted to feminine people how could I possibly see myself as attractive as a guy? How could any guy see himself as attractive for that matter. It seems totally logical to me that most amab people would want to see themselves as attractive - and they are attracted to women - so they would want to look like women. It's an ego thing. Of course I want to feel good about how I look and I think women look good! Can someone point out the flaw in my thinking here? Why don't all straight guys have this problem?

I'm at about 2 years of HRT and I pass nearly all of the time now. I trained my voice for hundreds of hours and it rarely gets clocked anymore.

I am planning on getting FFS but I want to make sure I don't end up with body dysmorphia where I can never be truly ok with how I look. As of right now I think I should still go ahead with transition and FFS and deal with any dysmorphia that comes up later. I can't see going back to being a guy which I find completely disgusting and unappealing.

Thanks for reading my sleepy psychobabble rant.

EDIT: add masochistic emasculation fetish to the list of driving factors. That is probably a big one for me.","Reading what you have written, you seems to have taken the right way. Keep going! FFS gives highly satisfying results! You will blossom into a beautiful girl and you will appreciate yourself!

27ilep,tardtales,"Ghetto autistic vs skinnytard Back five or six years ago when I was in 8th grade, I had gym class with a skinny, short tard named Matthew. At the beginning of the year Matthew was really friendly and nice to everyone in his own tard way. Soon though he began to get more and more violent. I remember when we played basketball and he kicked me hard in the shin to get the ball. Also he got less and less coherent and it turned into total tard speak - no one could understand him. By February or march people began to get sick of his shit but no one said anything. Enter Tyler - he looked normal, ironically he actually looked exactly like Tyler the creator, just more husky. He was able to speak coherently, but he was in the tard class so obviously he had some mental challenge. he was quiet and kept to himself most of the time. He was really ghetto as well. The only thing he said to me the entire year was ""run nigga it's the po-leeece!"" And he was fast as fuck. Usain bolt could not beat him in a race. One time we were running around the track. Matthew mumbles to himself and does his slow tard jog. We want to make him feel good so we give him a one lap head start. Suddenly, a streak of chocolate lightning flashes past us. Tyler is pumping his legs as if he's got marijuana on him and the po-po are On in hot pursuit. He is within meters of Matthew... He is about to pass Matthew... Matthew does not like this. As tyler is about to pass him, he pushes him with all of his tard might. Big mistake. We all stand in awe of the shit that is about to go down. Tyler comes to a stop, as Matthew does. Matthew gives him a toothy tard grin. Tyler narrows his eyes. Slowly Tyler cocks back his right arm and launches it with the force of god. Time slows. His dark arm connects perfectly with Matthew's pale tard face. Matthew's head jerks back as if pulled by a string. Matt spits a little blood than staggers and falls, tears streaming, letting out a loud tard screech. The gym teacher is in total shock, and is speechless. Time goes back to normal. Tyler takes a deep breath, and exhales. He looks at Matthew dead in the eye, and says ""fuck you pussy ass bitch nigga, don't fuck wid me mawfucka imma fuck you up bitch."" This is my first time hearing so many words in a combination from him - never has he said so much in one sentence. As the tard handlers come to take him to the principal's,  he stares at Matthew the entire way. We were in total awe of Tyler's raw power, and looked at him with reverence from that day on.","[Paragraphs, motherfucker, do you do them?](http://screenmusings.org/PulpFiction/images/Pulp-Fiction-036.jpg)

419s9c,fPUA,"[27/f] seeking advice about moves made by [23/f] Well, I'm new to reddit and am doing this because I so desperately need/want advice. I'll try to hit the important details without rambling...

I had an old work acquaintance sort of reappear in my life via facebook, it had been some time since we had spoken and I was happy to hear from her. Also found out that she had come out and was gay. She invited both me and my gf (of 5 years, whom she also worked with) 3 or 4 times over a 6 month period until we were finally able to attend a local show. 

The night was a lot of fun, convo between us was even easier than it had been a few years ago. At the end of the night, somehow she stole me away into the bathroom, and I never suspected this would happen between her and I, but we kissed. I even told my gf the next day that it happened, she of course asked that I cut off (and block) all communication with this old friend, haven’t spoken to her since the day after it happened. I’m conflicted about my situation and over the years my gf and I’s friends have molded into one group and I have no unbiased, outside opinion.

After the kiss happened I tried to blow it off, focused on my relationship, everything was surprisingly fine within a month or so. (Trying to ignore the fact that that stolen kiss set my chest on fire like nothing I’ve ever felt before. It was amazing.) Things were ""back to normal"", I would replay that night over and over, realizing there had been stolen glances throughout the night, wonderful conversation, and remembering how much I enjoyed her company. And realized I couldn’t just blow it off. It meant something. I wondered if her many attempts to hang out were with intention. Maybe I even always had feelings for her…idk, trying not to ramble here. There was just a strong connection with her that night.

Fast forward 6 months: My SO proposed to me a few weeks ago, and that is when major doubt set in. Why couldn't I stop thinking about that night? The urge to contact this old friend, to know if there was anything behind that kiss for her, if she felt anything emotional inside of her, or if I’m just crazy and about to risk fucking up my relationship. 

Part of me says just make it go away, get over it, and focus on the relationship. Then part of me says maybe this is a red flag that I even want to contact this friend, maybe I shouldn’t even be in this relationship if I can’t get my shit together. Problem is this relationship has been rocky and up/down for the last 3 years; we've worked through a lot of shit, and mostly I've had to work through things she's done to me. 

But this woman, this old friend…she’s something special. Friends, I need advice, from any viewpoint, any thoughts on this at all, I feel afraid of making the wrong choice whether it be contacting her, not contacting her, getting married without trying… The last thing she said to me was that she wanted me to be happy. Did I already miss a chance with her? Would she even want to be with someone who has done this while in a relationship? Or was she not even coming on to me at all?? I can't think clearly about this anymore, so please help!!

I'm sorry if I rambled too much...happy to clarify things.","The new is always more exciting/intense than the old. It's difficult sorting out which feelings are ""real"" versus which are transient. I don't think this means you need to break up, but I do think you shouldn't get married (yet). We all have doubts periodically, and it's why many people get cold feet around marriage. You need to ask yourself whether you really want to spend the rest of your life with your gf, whether you enjoy her company and you have similar values etc. Note that you may not actually be this compatible with your friend, although I'm not sure how close you two were before. But even if you're not compatible, it's not fair to your current partner to commit more while you're sorting out your emotions. 

And yes, of course she was coming onto you. Did you set up that kiss? Did you arrange the outing? Did you entertain thoughts of her before that night? (If the answer is yes to these, then you should reconsider the relationship itself, but otherwise, your friend likely wanted you like you wanted her, in that moment.)",0

5lxcg4,Incel,"Unusual ways of coping I think i've hit rockbottom last year guys, i'm nearly 30 years old, still a KHHV but i still desperately want a girlfriend. See, I was always into anime and so was my oneitis in school, so i guess i never grew out of anime since she always made me have hope that anime wasn't a pussy repellent. The thing is, i never had the balls to ask her out before we went to different colleges and we lost contact. On january 2016 i found her on facebook and she is married to a fucking chad and i didn't find anything anime related on her facebook so not only i lost my oneitis but i also confirmed that no girl actually likes anime. As a way to cope, i started taking part in anime forum ERP, one thing led to another and now i'm a babyfur. Roleplaying as a cub is the only thing preventing me from eating lead. I know this might sounds weird but life is hard sometimes: you need to push a mop 8 hours a day, will never get a girlfriend and receive a paycheck smaller them your dick. So i'm not saying i'm proud of what i do but it helps me stay alive i guess. Any of you guys do some unusual stuff to cope as well?","Isn't it possible to enjoy anime without being an outcast, though?

I'm really nerdy when it comes to computers, electronics, obscure movies, TV and music. I really enjoy the tiniest of details and every so often go full geek, studying booklets from weird albums, ploughing through the back catalog of some east european film director, trying to solder together an interesting electronic circuit, etc. A good saturday night is one where I can watch a movie with my kids and wife, then stay up with a beer and work on some programming project when the wife's asleep.

None of my friends or family enjoy these things, but since I keep that stuff for dedicated me-time (which is absolutely necessary when you have kids) people don't see me as weird just because of my hobbies. I'll get the occational remark about my desktop background being a photo of an old Amiga motherboard. I sometimes reference something way too obscure and people look at me funny. But that's okay. My most jocky colleagues respect me because my geeky nature gets shit done at work, so I'll take a joke here and there and just don't worry about it. They accept me even though I know nothing about the sports they chat about at lunch. We can bond over the few things we do have in common, as long as we both maintain interest and a friendly attitude towards each other.

So what I'm saying is that perhaps your attitude to other people is part of what makes you so insecure about yourself. It sounds like you are depressed (suicide thoughts, having to resort to the ""addiction"" of online sexual roleplay, etc) and you should try to get help for that. Also, try going outside on your spare time a couple of nights per week. It's free, it works magic on your mental state, and it's exercise. When you work that into a habit, you'll feel more able to interact with other people, which is what will eventually lead you into a relationship.

Good luck!",0

cek456g,PussyPass,"I know exactly how you feel. Trust me. You're not alone in feeling this way; if nothing else I say to you matters, at least listen to that. As far as being forcefully taken to a ""loony bin"", I cannot deny your claim, as I do not know you or your life, but I *can* tell you my experience.

When I was in high school, my depression was controlling my life. Every day I went home and cried myself to sleep about how badly I wanted to end my life. I made stupid facebook posts about how terrible my life was, and most of them went ignored. Or so I thought.

One day, in the middle of class, I was called to guidance, the meaning of which I was not told; however, I had a strong feeling that I knew. The night before I posted yet another one of my suicidal statuses, expecting nobody to read it or care about it like what had happened before. My assumption was incorrect this time. My councilor told me that he wanted to make sure I was okay, that I wasn't going to hurt myself. Since I had never even considered admitting my suicidal tendencies to anyone, especially a total stranger, I denied it all, saying it was all a misunderstanding. And I *wasn't* forced into a loony bin. I went back to class, and that was the end of that.

The next year, still suffering from depression, I made a subtle hint to a friend that I wanted to kill myself. Apparently it wasn't subtle enough, because the next day I was once again removed from class and sent to guidance. My councilor, a new one, as the old one only covered the Freshmen, did the same thing as the old one: the ""How are you, are you okay, are you going to hurt yourself"" talk. Once again I denied it, but not as strongly this time. She told me that she was going to call my parents and notify them of the report. Like any teenager would be, I was terrified. *My parents were going to get a call home from school, oh my God, they're gonna kill me!* But when I got home that day, my parents did not visit me out of anger, but out of care for my well-being. They talked to me about things, and asked how I was. At the end of the talk, they reminded me that I could always talk to them.

I never wanted to talk to anyone about my depression. I always figured that nobody cared, and even on the off-chance that someone did, they wouldn't want to hear someone moping around feeling sorry for themselves; I didn't think I knew anybody who loved me enough to put themselves through that for me. I did, I just never realized it. I found out the identity of the person who reported me to guidance: we'll call her Courtney. Courtney had become one of my very good friends through that year, and we were on pace to become best friends, maybe more than that. She was always special to me for some reason: even during freshman year, in which I only spoke to her a couple times, I always had my eye on her. In a way, I guess you could say I had a small crush on her, although I didn't realize it until later. Anyway, she reported me to guidance because she cared about my well-being. I couldn't comprehend it. Someone caring about me? No, that's impossible. I asked her the next time I saw her, and she admitted it. Her words sounded like that of another language, almost as if English was not my native tongue for just a moment. But she cared. She told me that I was not hopeless, that I was not doomed to a life of sorrow, and that she wanted me to get help. She begged me:

 &gt; ""Ryan, please talk to someone about this. Don't just bottle it up inside you; you can get over this depression. If not for you, then for me. I can't just sit here and ignore that my close friend wants to kill themself... If you did something to hurt yourself, I don't think I could take it.""

(The quote is paraphrased, since my memory of sophomore year is not perfect.)

So I did. Not for myself - I hated myself, I did not want to live, I wanted to die, and I thought that's all I would ever want - I did it for her. Because she was my friend who thought enough about me to report me to guidance. I walked into my parents' room, sat down on the bed, and said, ""I want to talk to someone. I want professional help."" A short conversation later, and they agreed. I had an appointment with a behavioral therapist the next week.

When the day came, I was nervous: I had no idea what to expect, and I still believed that nobody could truly understand me, or care. I didn't trust the doctor; a wall prevented me from saying the truth, instead stating only certain things that I felt comfortable with sharing. Week by week, that wall came down. I learned many valuable lessons during my time in therapy. The first day, he taught me to stop using the words ""good"" and ""bad"" to describe emotions, that sadness is no worse than happiness; they are instead just a state of being. This helped me because whenever I felt sad (depressed) I thought about how ""bad"" I felt, and that belief that it was a ""bad"" thing to be depressed made me feel even worse. Indeed, people want to be happy more than they want to be sad, but the idea is that *all* emotions will happen from time to time, and that it is not a ""good"" or ""bad"" thing to experience one or the other. I still practice this advice nearly everyday, and I never would have learned that tip if I didn't get professional help, and I never would have gotten professional help if I didn't know someone cared about me, which would have never happened if Courtney didn't report me to guidance that one day sophomore year.

Please, even if you think nobody cares about you, that you are hopeless, and that all you want is to die, don't do it without first talking to someone. It doesn't have to be a professional, even a friend, loved one, heck, even Mom and Dad can be a good place to start. If you don't want to for them, then please at least do it for me. /u/Nozphexezora, please talk to someone about this. Don't just bottle it up inside you; you can get over this depression.

*EDIT*: Also, you have a very interesting blog. I'd like to read through it sometime, if you don't mind. It would be a shame for someone with such a philosophical mind to end their life.","I've already fucking told people. The only people that care about me is my Dad and maybe my Mom, and they don't care about me that much. And you know how many people tried helping me when I spent my entire last year at school with my head buried in my knees? Nobody. Nobody gave a shit. I was still tormented by other people and it continued in University. University. Tertiary level education. And there's still a group of people that went out of their way to ostrasize me.

What the fuck does it even matter? I can't blame them for not caring. We're given this package of convenience and luxury so we can float through life and die with a gravestone plaque that means nothing. All the while people are suffering the real torments of life over in Syria or Liberia. I'm nothing. And even if I was something I couldn't express it - art's left to the people with talent.

I've been to so many people. And it's not just depression. It's my drug addiction too. And I can't just quit that. I'd rather not, as much as it pains me to constantly have to do it. At least at night (in about half an hour) I get to feel like life matters. Like I can just sit down on my ground mattress, watch Sopranos or Adventure Time in my little Opium Den and enjoy myself just for that time for once. And I can go another day thinking that I don't need a friend.",0
cho711e,PussyPass,"&gt; The plain fact of the matter is that women abuse children FAR MORE OFTEN than men do (and not merely in sheer numbers, but actually at far higher rates)

While your post is solid, I'm gonna need some kinda source for that particular claim.  While male rape/molestation is vastly underreported (even when compared with female rape reports), saying that women do it far more often is a new one on me.","&gt;  I'm gonna need some kinda source for that particular claim.

Well then -- rather than simply continuing in your bien pensant belief -- [why don't you go look for some data.](https://www.google.com/search?q=women+abuse+children+more+often)

&gt;While male rape/molestation is vastly underreported (even when compared with female rape reports), saying that women do it far more often is a new one on me.

Abuse consists of a LOT more than ""rape/molestation"" (as currently legally defined) -- there are all kinds of neglect &amp; abuse that are *not* ""sexual"" -- and even with the latter, [much of the *sexual* abuse behavior that women commit is not labeled as such, and is often disguised or dismissed as ""nurturing""](http://www.secasa.com.au/pages/breaking-the-last-taboo-sexual-abuse-by-female-perpetrators/); there is an all-too-common (pervasive) societal  ""dogmatic ideology"" that is simply -- **categorically** -- ""oblivious"" to such things.

I'm starting to understand much more clearly what it's meant to be a man in this world. One of the things I started doing recently was saying no to people and standing my ground. I've said no to people before, but today was something I never expected to happen. I was waiting for my mom at the bank (had to pick her up from work today). I was parked next to the drive through atm, but there was enough room for another car to pass by. Some guy behind me got impatient (after not even 5 minutes) and came to my car window, telling me to move. I told him I was waiting for my mom and it wasn't going to be long, and he said he didn't care, demanding me to move. The guy could have backed up and gone around the atm, but he decided to order me to move instead. If he had actually asked I would have, but he was clearly being disrespectful. Now the old me would've put my tail between my legs and moved, but instead I looked at him in his eyes and told him ""Don't tell me what to do."" They guy probably in his late 40's early 50's just exploded. It was almost surreal the way he reacted. He was screaming, threatening to ram his car into mine, so I called him bluff and told him to go right ahead in a calm voice. He was talking about how he was going to punch me in the face, but didn't do anything except fumble his body around in a ""threatening"" way. He then just walked off. I never experienced anyone lose their cool so quickly before. So I'm curious has anything like this ever happened to you before? ","It's happened to me a few times.

njpfrk,ForeverAloneDating,"26 [M4F] - Pennsylvania, USA for Anywhere, USA - Quiet, laid-back dude looking for his loud, fiery woman. My name's [Chris](http://imgur.com/a/ohSx9U7), and I'm a 26 year-old dude living in Pennsylvania. I work as a software engineer building emulation software for virtual environments. It's what I wanted to do in college, actually, but my degree is in creative writing. I've done NaNoWriMo a couple times, and a friend keeps pestering me to finish one of the four novels on my hard drive. We'll see. When I'm not doing those, I program, cook, bake, game, and learn. I'm actually trying to go back to school (read: take online classes) to essentially get all the practical knowledge of a computer science degree without having to pay another 80k. We'll see how that one goes, too.
 
I've got several app ideas that I'd really like to get off the ground by the end of this year. Keeping my fingers crossed on those.
 
In my spare time between both of those, you can find me oscillating between PC and tabletop gaming (The Binding of Isaac has usurped Fallout New Vegas as my favorite video game; Warhammer 40,000 is still my favorite tabletop game). I'm actually building my own tabletop game based on all the ones I used to and currently enjoy: I just got it ready for playtesting and want to get it onto Kickstarter by the end of year.

I'm used to my own silence and doing things for myself, but having someone to lean on and be leant on in turn is sure something, let me tell you. To boil things down to basics, I'm looking for someone who has, at the very least, these two qualities: one, a constant desire to improve themselves, if not the drive - we all fall off the wagon sometimes; two, a constant curiosity, whether that's about the world around us or anything else - I ask tons of questions and not having someone else asking questions alongside me just feels weird. 
 
Here's some of what I bring to the table:
 
* A love of almost all movies and TV (except for horror, no thank you!) I've recently been watching movies with my COVID book club, and have tried to keep up with what's currently playing, although the most recent thing I've seen is ""Knives Out"", which I really enjoyed despite not thinking I would.
 
* A penchant for creativity in the kitchen - I love love love to cook, and I'd love to feed you my recipes, from raspberry cheesecake to beef stew to smoked gouda pizza.
 
* A love for hiking, camping and the outdoors. Hiking the Appalachian Trail is on my bucket list, and I'd love to have somebody to hike it with.

* A love of learning. I absolutely adore museums - especially if they have interactive exhibits. I will always be down to go to the zoo, or the aquarium (I never got to see the Baltimore Aquarium before I moved, and really want to) or any kind of museum that takes your fancy. I'd love to just wander through a museum with someone, sharing the little tidbits we learn as we go.
  
* The ability to listen when you talk, provide sage advice, and just generally be the rock in the currents of life.

What I'm looking for:

* Someone who's just as much of a homebody as I am. Prefers staying indoors and nerding out to bars and clubs.

* Someone who constantly wants to improve themselves, whether that's working out, learning a new skill, or just reading a new book. (I'm currently reading Discworld for the first time, myself!)
  
* Someone who wants to get to know me almost as much as I know myself, and doesn't mind my learning them just as well.
 
* Someone who asks just as many questions as I do, whether somewhat off the wall (""What did you want to be when you grew up, and why did that change as you got older?"") or somewhat trite (Favorite snacks, favorite colors, things like that).
 
* Someone who enjoys hiking and bonfires, and is okay with at least giving fencing and/or paintball a try.
 
* Someone who has, if not a plan, then at least a bucket list that I can help cross things off of.

* Someone who's also kinky (at least a little bit).
 
Some dealbreakers:
 
* Smoking, either cigarettes or MJ - mostly because I hate the smell.
 
* The inability to hold a conversation. Getting to know someone's a two-way street, and if I find myself asking all the questions, I'll also find myself getting bored pretty quickly.

* Kids. I do not want kids in any way, shape or form.
 
I promised myself when I sat down that I wouldn't write a novel, so I'm going to cut myself off now. Feel free to delve through my posting history, though. If you like what you read, shoot me a message - I look forward to hearing from you!
 
Best,

jv7d9c,RedPillWives,"Struggling with roles (married 6 years, 1 kid) I'm happy to find this community. I grew up with more of a ""modern"" family, both my parents worked and had equal responsibility in housework, speaking up, etc. I always wanted to be a housewife when I was young. I worked full-time until I had my baby, 4 months post partum I went to part-time. I currently still work part-time and at home with my daughter the rest of the time. We could afford myself quitting (which I consider all the time) but I do love making the extra money to spend on me and my daughter, and getting out of the house a couple days a week. My husband has always said he likes the traditional role of marriage but doesn't mind me working if I enjoy it. He still expects me to do the all of the household work (minus outdoor chores and dealing with the pets) and take care of our child. He works 40-50 hours a week and is working from home due to COVID. I love the idea of being a housewife but in the back of my mind I have doubts and think of people judging me for having the housewife ideals and being ""under my husband"" (my mother has brought up to me before how she doesn't like how I cater to him).  

I struggle with the time period when he is done with work and before our daughter goes to bed. I understand he wants to relax and un-wind after working all day , but I feel like he needs to do more because by the time he is done with work I am burnt out and ready to pass out. He will usually just watch TV/movies or play on his phone, we have had the conversation regarding his phone and that has improved but I still get soo annoyed. I feel like he hasn't seen his daughter all day because he was working doesn't he want to play with her and interact?! (mind you he does interact with our daughter and plays with her, but I feel like it needs to be more, a me issue)

Also how do you guys find time to do it all?!! I need my workout time to un-wind. Somedays I will work out after dinner and my husband will be with our daughter, and somedays I wait until she goes to bed if I'm not passed out by then.

es4zwgh,WatchRedditDie,"&gt;Permissible restrictions on expression

&gt;Despite the broad freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment, there are some historically rooted exceptions. First, the government may generally restrict the time, place, or manner of speech, if the restrictions are unrelated to what the speech says and leave people with enough alternative ways of expressing their views. Thus, for instance, the government may restrict the use of loudspeakers in residential areas at night, limit all demonstrations that block traffic, or ban all picketing of people’s homes.

&gt;Second, a few narrow categories of speech are not protected from government restrictions. The main such categories are incitement, defamation, fraud, obscenity, child pornography, fighting words, and threats. As the Supreme Court held in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), the government may forbid “incitement”—speech “directed at inciting or producing imminent lawless action” and “likely to incite or produce such action” (such as a speech to a mob urging it to attack a nearby building). But speech urging action at some unspecified future time may not be forbidden.

&gt;Defamatory lies (which are called “libel” if written and “slander” if spoken), lying under oath, and fraud may also be punished. In some instances, even negligent factual errors may lead to lawsuits. Such exceptions, however, extend only to factual falsehoods; expression of opinion may not be punished even if the opinion is broadly seen as morally wrong.

&gt;Fighting words—defined as insults of the kind likely to provoke a physical fight—may also be punished, though general commentary on political, religious, or social matters may not be punished, even if some people are so upset by it that they want to attack the speaker. Personalized threats of illegal conduct, such as death threats, may also be punished.

Exceptions to the First Amendment of the US constitution. So, no you can't just say anything you want and have people accept it. If you insult people to their face, expect repercussions.","Yea, but the habit of broad hatred to trump supporters isn't exactly in line with this. Sure maybe they made threats, I don't actually know the situation. If they did then yea fine but, my problem is people all over acting like every single trump supporter is a violent racist which is just false.  There are plenty of people that support trump who are not racist or violent yet, people shit on them and censor them simply for supporting trump. 

My comment wasn't about this internet specifically, it's about the overall mentality of people who oppose and hate truml supporters just based in the fact that they support trump. I mean how many people do we see getting hit for wearing a MAGA hat? Or people threatening trump supporters and screaming at them that they are racists when in actuality they are not. 

Both sides have become incapable of having a peaceful dialogue and it's a big big problem. Both sides ban and censor opposing views living in their little bubbles.

ehhi542,Radical_Feminists,"I mean, it exists. I think denying that it exists is like saying that white privilege doesn’t exist. 

Backstory: i used to weigh over 300 lbs. now I’m in the “normal” BMI range. I was treated much different professionally when i was heavier vs when i was thinner. When you’re that heavy, the first thing that most people see when you enter a room is your weight. Just like if you’re extremely thin, that will be the first thing they notice. 

I am much happier now that I’ve lost weight. I also feel more confident which likely influences how i present myself, and how people treat me. I am sure that my opinions and thoughts are more readily paid attention to than they used to be. 

I theorize that morbidly obese people are stereotypically viewed as lacking control and order in their lives. That they’re lazy. I have had people voice these kind of things to me, not knowing i used to be morbidly obese myself.  
","I agree that obese people are often thought of as being lazy or out of control, but I don't think that necessarily amounts to privilege for thin people. 

I also don't think you can compare the experience of being fat with being black. There isn't the history there to inform the oppression (to my knowledge, fat people were never systematically kidnapped and enslaved for generations by thin people) and, furthermore, body size is changeable to some degree whereas skin color is not.

Unless they tell you directly, it's tough to tease out what in the behavior of others comes from your size and what comes from your demeanor. I'm glad you're happier and more confident now and I do honestly hope that your confidence is what the people in your life are responding to when they take you more seriously now and not just your body size.",0

Blacks did not. They evolved to live as savages in a Jungle eviroment filled with wildebeests and things that can kill you. Only the strong, violent and impulsive survived. And that's why they are the way they are. It's science.

If you really wanna prove to me that they are ready to live among civilized people than THEY have to show us they're ready. It's not OUR fault we think this way, it's their fault. Nobody told us to think this way, we made judgements based on the reality of what we see and hear every day.

He brought some needed levity to the show. Still, there were times his ego seemed like it was getting bigger than his sense of respect and gratitude for Tim, who gave him an awesome platform and springboard. 

In a way Adam reminds me of that friend who needs to crash on your couch for a month. Week one he's super appreciative and going out of the way to help and be respectful. Week two it wears off. Week three he's in command of your living room and having company 6 nights a week. Week four you're wondering what you got yourself into, and that's when he tells you he needs another month. 

Not the perfect metaphor, but an example of that guy who gets too comfy too soon in a space that's not really his. Apparently Tim is still letting Adam do his podcast out of his studio. I think it's pretty gracious of Tim. How many of Joe Rogan's competitors use his studio? That's technically what Adam is.","Absolutely this. 

Adam was nothing but playdough at first.  He eventually started to take form once he learned some things. Eventually he took it personally when Tim would explain things to him. You could see all the times Adam got so butthurt. But Adam eventually started standing up for himself and would interject so much it ground the show to a stop for a moment. Some would even say tim mansplained to a man at those times, but I took it as a way to explain it to the audience who might be new so understandable.

What Adam was supposed to be was someone to converse with about a topic . Whether it was in union or opposition. But not causing it to stop. If he did it every few episodes okay, but he does it at least once an episode.

clsimdl,TheRedPill,"&gt; This is not a requirement within marriage, in my opinion, as long as you don't let yourself go outside the realm of a normal male body. Don't get fat, basically.

TRP is not about being average. Nothing is ever a requirement for marriage, but going ham at the gym *will* build attraction. And if it doesn't, some bad shit is going on in your relationship.

&gt; You need to be sure she doesn't think you're cheating or going to divorce her.

That's exactly what you want her thinking. That's how dread game is supposed  to work.

&gt; How would you feel if your wife did the same thing with the waiter, or the bartender, and it felt like she was doing it with intent to cheat?

Dread game doesn't have the same results for men and women, don't expect your wife to react the way you would. And the point is not to flirt with the waitress like you want to take her home and fuck her, it is to build yourself as an object of attraction and someone that your wife sees as an object of attraction.

","&gt; That's exactly what you want her thinking. That's how dread game is supposed to work.

I disagree *in the context of marriage*.  (If you're just dating, then oh yeah, 100% agreed.)

In my opinion, dread game isn't supposed to make her think you ARE cheating or ARE going to divorce her, those are impending doom situations and will cause most people to shut down and prepare for a disaster.  And that just spirals out of control.

Proper dread game, in a marriage and in my opinion, should be more subtle.  It should invoke her desire to *compete* with these other women, by raising your SMV.  

&gt; And the point is not to flirt with the waitress like you want to take her home and fuck her, it is to build yourself as an object of attraction and someone that your wife sees as an object of attraction.

egh9znm,GenderCriticalGuys,"An addiction focused therapist might be good as well; they’ll be more likely to have a background understanding of the negative effects of porn, even if they don’t care to grasp its moral implications. 

And good on you, OP, for taking a hard look at the ethics of pornography. It’s a hard thing to do for many people but it truly speaks well to your character. ","She kind of smirked at me too when I suggested the notion if ""porn made me bisexual"" like I'm not even allowed to ask the question. I haven't really discovered my sexuality yet even though I had sex with both sexes. But that doesn't invalidate the damage porn can do. Its confusing because homosexuality is not a fetish clearly, but porn creates these illogical fetishes like foot fetishes, vore and tons of other nasty things. Porn clearly distorts your discernment and makes sexuality even more confusing. ",0

It’s shitty that media instantly jumped on to blaming people and then pretended that nothing happened when it turned out it was not “Trump people”.

But if the writing on the wall was a decoy to throw off the investigation and the reason to burn the church was to cover up after a burglary, it was not politically motivated. The goal (the motivation) was to avoid arrest, not to stir up political tension.

Of course it could have been both.

dipwfr4,pussypassdenied,"It's very rare that I tell this story. I never thought false rape accusations were a wide spread issue untill it happened to me. 

When I was going to university, this was maybe 2 years ago, I met this cool chick off of a pot head website and we became really good friends. Over time her roommate kept getting recycled into the mix and all of us would hang out and rarely but occasionally I would hang out with the roommate solo. I really should have figured something was fucked in her head when she told me she sold herself on backpage to pay rent.

Onevtime after ahe sid this she called us balling and told us to come pick her up, we did. She was crying she had been raped and the guy was to rough with her and all this stuff. Now I don't know what really happened but I know she opened herself up to being in shitty situations quite often. I buy her diner and hang out until she calms down and go on my way. This is about the time she first starts snapchattibg me nudes out of the shower and shit. 
I go over there one night and I'm pretty drunk, she is sober. She drags me into her room. Oral sex blah blah..tell her I don't want to sleep with her this night.

One day we both have math tests in the morning and no class in the afternoon so we decide we are going to get some chinesse food and hang out... We decide to buy a few bottles of wine and listen to music etc...

As the say goes on we are cuddleing on the couch making out every so ofter. She is sending me text messages while we are in tbe same room confessing her love for me. We get to the point where she is giving me hickies and I'm rubbing her but not actually fingering and I start to tell her how much I like her as a friend and I don't want to call us a couple. Everything is fine.

2 hours later I am being woken up by the police. I have no Idea wtf was going on but they are being complete dicks and want me in the back of the car... So there I sit for 2 hours while they are investigaing a rape where I am the suspect.

When they finally come out abd tell me what is going on I am completely lost. I flip my shit and start showing them the texts and hickies and showing how she is the aggressor through all the text.... 

Lucky me she decided not to persue charges (even though it eas all consensual) and I was realiesed on the spot, but it wassent over. For weeks a detective would call me trying to get me to come talk and the county prossecuter would call her trying to get her to file the charges. I know this bevause my original friend would tell me wgat was going on, on her roommates side.

Just because I was honest about not wanting to date my life was this close to veing ruined forever.

I still talk to the first girl I met. She knows how crazy her roommate is.

e6yfhxx,GCdebatesQT,"“Identify as” has always been a troublesome phrase in my view. Identities are fine and good, but the idea that someone can identify as something different than what they are and that society should be organized to accommodate this is where the whole identity thing loses me. Also, it’s sort of undermines itself some to extent because if you need to say you “identify as” something you are sort of acknowledging you aren’t that thing or aren’t seen as such, but you want to be accommodated in spite of that.","I agree. I think 'identifying' as something you are clearly not is to ask/expect/demand others to shelve their common sense reality for your unreality, and that is ultimately a selfish and unsustainable act. It's also ultimately a harmful act because it is a mutual lie that opens out into a spiderweb of more and more lies.",0

h36sxth,LouderWithCrowder,"&gt;A bathing suit top is not an extra rule. Literally, the only reason she was allowed to do this was because she said she identified as a boy. This defeats your whole argument. 

No it doesn't. You are so invested in the idea that a female disposing breasts is inherently sexual that you can't see their position is completely logical and airtight. And by the way, males have all the same equipment on their breasts as females, and if they have a hormonal imbalance, they can grow female breasts and lactate. It's called Gynocomastia. So they're literally the same thing. It's just a difference in looks. Society treats them as different because we've had a very stratified society for centuries based around sex, but the facts don't care about your feelings here. If one sex has a right, such as going topless, the other should have it too in any kind of free society. Or else, we should just stop pretending we want equality and just go back to the bronze age.","Yeah, ur reaching a little much for this to be relevant. This is a minor, this would against the law if she had not identified as a man, so that makes your whole point moot.

You would do better to make this case if she was an adult in the presence of only adults. But she is a minor in the presence of other minors.",0
um6rv0,TGandSissyRecovery,"I need help addicted to Femdom and findom I have been addicted to findom,femdom and joi porn for about 3 years.

e4u21r6,AganistGayMarriage,"I think I’m actually seeing your point. Many of the supposed “movements” that are going on aren’t positively contributing to obtaining rights for a minority group, but are, instead, creating a weird identity-based culture that seems very exclusive to people not of that identity.

I think that’s a perfectly fair perception to have.

Here’s the thing though: some of these movements might not be operated in the best way, just like how BlackLivesMatter is giving people such bad perception. Does that mean you necessarily HAVE to disagree with their motives?

Taking BlackLivesMatter as an example, does disagreeing with the way they operate mean that you have to disagree with their motive to give black people equal rights? Surely not.

I see the frustration, but I think it’s important to recognize that not all homosexual people are part of shallow identity-based movements, and the ones you don’t see truly just want a normal life like everyone else WITH the rights everyone else has.","Thank you, I don’t have a problem with normal lgbt people",0

There's more evidence all over but experts state it's about equal. The only difference is men are generally ignored at best and more likely to be accused as the aggressor anyways even when they don't defend themselves. It's a major issue. 

The gap has been disproven countless times, not sure why you're bringing that up. Which is why egalitarianism doesn't talk about it at all, because it's basically seen as the flat earth idea of the political landscape. Proven false countless times, yet still believed by many. I'm not even going to give a link for this one due to how easy it is to find dozens of studies on how it doesn't really exist when you bring in job differences, overtime, experience and haggling for raises which men are just better at the latter due to being naturally less agreeable. 

Also calling everyone Incel MRA chuds to those you disagree with is a real easy way to invalidate what you're talking about. Ad-hominens help no one's points. At best it pushes people away that would of been opening to talk and at worst it spreads that mindset to others and just makes everyone more aggressive and less open minded. 

Egalitarianism is about getting rid of all the circumstances where others are above the other sex. Thing is, the most important part is start with the systems in place that are systemic, and women are generally treated superior when it comes to that, where women are more equally screwed over is when we talk about social issues. Which are certainly apart of the discussion and should be talked about. Which is where murder by partner rates come in as it's not like those men aren't going to get hit by the law generally speaking, which makes it at most a social issue, a very extreme one, but one none the less. Though one could argue also that it's just a screwed up man and less a social issue. You're not going to teach criminals to stop being criminals, and murderers are murderers because of their own character, not because of a lack of being taught murder is bad and being a man.","&gt;Egalitarianism is about getting rid of all the circumstances where others are above the other sex.

g29exyq,aznidentity,"Yellow fever discussions nowadays is always about yellow fever for Asian men for the under 21 crowd, and entirely so for the under 18 crowd.

I actually hardly ever see anyone talk about yellow fever for Asian women except for Asian women themselves. And hardly any traction on the discussion. Most of people responding are Asian women and small amount of Asian men, usually gay men. Nobody really cares.

On the other hand I'm seeing viral content, 100k+ likes every 2 or 3 weeks, about yellow fever for Asian men. And the vast majority of the time, Asian men aren't the ones trying to push discussions about it. It's happening on its own from others.

Asian women in general are pretty irrelevant in mainstream society. The only space where I've seen them get a platform is sometimes through feminist discussions. You know those older dating stats...I think a more correct interpretation of that was actually just a preference to non-obese women and a misinterpretation to deem it as a race preference. Obesity rates are significantly lower (17% to 45% non-Asian) and men's standards are pretty much anyone not obese. Comparing fit women in general online spaces, Asian women honestly get very little attention. It makes more sense with what I'm seeing, as well as Asian women who speak about not feeling attractive growing up.

For younger people, I'm seeing Asian men have drastically more relevance and attention due to the attention garnered from Korean media representation.

Don't appear desperate for any groups validation. Whether it be the same race or another race. I'm seeing significantly increased attention and many people are forming their initial impressions of Asian men and by Asian men appearing to seek validation by optics, whether you actually are or you aren't, is not a good look.

If you really feel compelled to press the subject, do it with that in mind.","&gt;On the other hand I'm seeing viral content, 100k+ likes every 2 or 3 weeks, about yellow fever for Asian men.

And now a nice little ramble:

----

I'm Rlack, the Independent Candidate for Kent &amp; East Sussex, and I'm asking for your helping hand in my bid to win this seat. I am running on a sort of ""Patriotic Socialist"" platform - don't be misled, I don't blindly follow the real ideology of the real party, and I am not simply a diluted National Socialist (despite how hilarious that would be. I am simply a Socialist that realises the importance of national identity and a common brotherhood uniting the people of a nation - core principles, ideals and ideas that we must defend and uphold.

I have chosen to run as an independent because the conventional left have consistently failed to realise this reality, consistently failed to defend Britain; the modern left breeds a peculiar contempt for the idea of ""nationality"" and the common identity that binds us together, and have instead perpetrated a destructive erosion of these core principles in favour of a cold, faceless and characterless Britain. This societal emptiness appears to be prevalent across all of the mainstream left, only becoming more depressingly apparent the further left you go. This consensus of the left to act against the acts of the British cultural identity must be overcome, and I represent that alternative. A vote for /u/Rlack is a vote for an altruistic Britain, caring for one another, increasing workplace democracy for all involved, whilst never forgetting that one of the key uniting elements of life is one that cannot be codified or rationally summarised, but is the national spirit, pride &amp; patriotism that brings the people of Britain and towards a common goal.

If you want to smash this corrupt ideal, and bring forth into /r/MHoC and British politics a new left, an alternative left that stands up for Britain and patriotism, without forgetting the economics needs of the people of Britain, then please - people of Kent &amp; East Sussex, vote /u/Rlack to be your MP.",vote RC,0

Just see how the diamond trade operates. The palm oil operates. It destroy forest and farming land because it's cheap to mine out ores there. 

The rich land owner in Africa don't give a fuck about the population starving (i'd know, my country's billionaires are half of them), they want to create as much revenue as possible and they are ready to pay the first corrupt official to turn a blind eye on their nasty business.

evu3udr,ChapoTrapHouse,"Medical billing and coding jobs will decrease because that is a complexity introduced by private companies. Cigna will probably lose a significant part of it's $64B market cap, although many countries do have private facilities along with public, so there would likely still be a premium market for some healthcare. There will be fewer jobs that support the current system, but I expect that wouldn't be a 100% contraction, as the increase in overall use of healthcare will continue to drive job growth. I make good money and have ""good insurance"" , but the out of pocket costs still result in me avoiding or delaying seeing a doctor. I need foot surgery that I will never get in this country without Medicare for All (which would enable me to walk more for health, reduce my frequent back pain and increase my quality of life). If I wasn't facing a bill of over $7K minimum, I would like to get it done. Eventually I will probably look to a private facility in Europe to get it done. If it's going to cost me that much money, I might as well get a European vacation (hotels, meals, sightseeing - all money into the European economy and out of ours)","&gt; Medical billing and coding jobs will decrease because that is a complexity introduced by private companies.

Not entirely. Regulations are *constantly*, and I really do mean *constantly*, making changes to how all sorts of things need to be coded and billed and marked in order to receive payment from government services e.g. medicare/medicaid. I write software for medical billing and consequently have to get CC'd in on every notice that providers get about billing changes from the government. The level of finicky bullshit is astounding. I highly doubt that even a plan that ""covers everything"" will do away with this level of micromanagement, it absolutely takes a lot of effort to stay in compliance.

Don't mistake that for me saying that we should continue doing what we're doing or that M4A is a bad idea, but people are either ignorant of kidding themselves if they think the US government doesn't cause a shitload of administrative overhead all on their own.

w1m3m0,ForeverAloneDating,"24 [M4F] Florida/USA - shy, nerdy guy looking for the one Hello! Thank you for clicking my post! I'm a 24 year old from Florida with a whole lot of love and attention to give, but no one to give it to :( I've made posts to these kinds of subreddits before and have met a lot of cool (and not so cool) people, but nothing long lasting so I wanted to give it another shot because I know you're out there somewhere! 

I'm definitely looking for a more serious relationship out of this, but of course starting as friends is probably the best way to go about it, so I'm not opposed to making just friends if we don't make it past that stage, but a relationship is definitely what I'm looking for. I'm looking for my person. Someone I can talk to all day about anything and everything, just enjoying each others company whether it be text, call, or in person. I miss that happy excited feeling you get when that special someone messages you... I want that again, and I want to be that for you! I miss sending and receiving the cute good morning and night texts. I tend to put a LOT of effort into someone I'm interested in so ideally you can match that. My love languages are definitely quality time, and words of affirmation, but physical touch is a close third. 

Some basics about me: I'm 6'0, Caucasian, dark brown hair and eyes, short beard. I've been told I'm attractive, cute, handsome, etc. but I'll let you decide that for yourself, I'm down to trade pics after we get introduced. But this is my post, so you go first! I do have a preference for shorter hispanic or asian girls, but that's not a major thing I'm down to talk to anyone. 

My likes: Music, video games, losing track of time on YouTube, endlessly scrolling through reddit while trying to fall asleep, sports, memes, rollercoasters, traveling, stocks, probably way more I'm not thinking of at the moment but you'll find out about 'em soon!

Dislikes: Tomatoes, slow drivers, gas prices, **people who ghost**, and people who either take everything seriously or nothing at all seriously. But my main dislike is people who ghost. Please do not message me if instead of telling someone you aren't interested you ghost them, or your way of getting out of a conversation is to ghost. I'll be straight up with you about everything, I'm just asking you do the same for me.

Gonna leave it there because it looks like it's getting long in the live preview window, but if you're out there I really do hope to hear back from you! If you're interested by any of this please reach out! I will answer everyone :)","Thank you for posting, /u/AwkwardBread69. Please know that your thread has been locked, as all posts on this sub are.

8cbdgu,Delraymisfits,"Why I dropped out of college (Old Ment) Bessie explains how she became entrepreneur https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EXj3xzkcdk

17:30 onwards: Bessie explains how she joined GEM in New York (Entrepreneurship pyramid scheme) and met like minded entrepreneur. Next day flew to Miami with them (notice doesn't specify gender) then stayed there for about 9 days. 

Decides to drop out of college to build empire because she met fellow like minded entrepreneur and moved to Florida with them to split rent for a few months. She has epiphany that education while good for most doesn't work with her style of success. 

When Bessie said you are probably wondering how I will support myself and build my brand she said I have a gameplan and theres things you dont need to know/I want to surprise you. Old IG posts claim she is a forex trader that earns several hundred thousands of dollars a year. To make that kind of money you need to be trading millions to make it profitable after taxes. GEM person probably was involved in forex trading and showed her some technical analysis/charting youtube videos. ""Certified forex trader""

tldr: Bessie most likely met some rich old dude at a pyramid scheme marketing thing in NY. Felt a ""real connection and similar entrepreneur mindset"" so she went to FL with him for 9 days. Old dude convinced her shes ""smart"" so she dropped out of college and then moved there with him to split the cost of living. Bessie probably got paid monthly allowances in exchange for her cooch and thats how she was able to get those cars. Then eventually she met Peejay and fell for the Janoy Cresva sponsership to build brand.

ckfzfs0,asktrp,"Actually the majority of societies have obtained most of their calories from agriculture and gathering, not hunting (with a few exceptions like Eskimos and some African tribes). Hunting is dangerous and requires much greater energy expenditure than agriculture and especially gathering and wasn't very efficient for humans until weapons, trapping, and tracking were developed and in the beginning hunting *parties* with good leadership (rather than the skills and equipment of a few individuals) who could cooperate would be more successful than a few lone alpha hunters. Besides, the societies that eat the most meat simply raise the animals—feeding them the labor-freeing fruits of agriculture or following a nomadic lifestyle—and then slaughtering them and/or eating their milk/eggs/honey. Anyways what i'm getting at: there are many more forms of dominance than just being a successful hunter. One could have social dominance, one could own lots of land and produce more food growing it and raising animals rather than hunting, etc. 

EDIT: I would also add that fishing is also a viable option for food and is quite passive in most instances, relying on skill and knowledge rather than physical stamina or the like and an old skilled fisherman could keep up with or exceed the youth in such a field.",Thank you for the historical insight.

*****
&gt; The President of Germany&amp;#039;s Federal Police, Dieter Romann, says that if a missing passport hinders the deportation of an illegal alien believed to pose a terrorist threat, as was the case with Berlin terror suspect Anis Amri, then Germany should issue temporary ID papers itself.

&gt; &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s a question of their national laws. The interior minister and the foreign minister have taken the initiative in convincing a number of countries to accept laissez-passer papers issued by the EU or EU states like Germany. This initiative has already had success with countries in the western Balkans, but with others it hasn&amp;#039;t. But the sort of conversations the federal police president suggested are already underway.""

&gt; In his interview, Romann echoed calls by Germany&amp;#039;s interior minister earlier this month to give federal authorities the power to carry out the deportations of foreigners considered to pose a threat.

Drawing comparisons between a society with a fixed, inherited class and one entirely without seems silly and pointless. Yes there are class and mobility issues throughout the west but there is no fixed class structure you are born into and then forced to remain in. If that were the case one might rightly argue that violence was a reasonable solution. But it's not.

It could further be argued that the French Revolution itself did not need to be as bloody as it was. Same with the American Revolution. Though such an argument might ignore the impact of both those revolutions on the direction of other Western societies that later ended up in the same place without violent revolution.

ddp8u8t,GenderCritical," I'm Lierre, one of the organizers of WoLF Fest, here to answer your questions.
Our event will never be the size of Michigan, sadly, for many, many reasons. The biggest being that WoLF Fest is by and for radical feminists, which leaves us with a small pool of participants. We will never let men attend. The trans issue is a hill we are willing to die on. 
WoLF Fest will always be in Crescent City, CA. We are in the process of buying 25 acres of land here (and may be able to get another 80 at a later date). The land is gorgeous, of course, in the middle of the redwood forest with a year-round, coho-bearing stream. Two of us live in Crescent City, and the amount of work that goes into an event of this size is unfeasible from a distance. This is where we live so this is where we have to do it. Two of us worked full-time for about six weeks going into the festival date, and others added time as they could. 
I highly encourage those of you who live far, far away to organize other radical feminist and women-only events. We can't have too many.
Last year's date was chosen before Ohio had announced theirs, but I don't think we could have done much regardless. We could only afford off-season rates at the camp we rented. Past mid-September and there is no guarantee of clear weather. This is a temperate rain forest--you don't want an outdoor event during the rainy season. That September date was the only date available where rain would not be a worry.
I'm not sure how much overlap there was between the two events regardless. They let men in, we don't. They are on the east coast, we are on the west. Most women weren't going to be able to do both events even if the dates had been different (money, time off, etc.) and the different locations as well as different themes are going to appeal to different women. We have a very selective appeal and we want to keep it that way.
We did have carpools from both PDX and SFO, and I'm sure that will continue through the years. I know that still doesn't work for everyone, but in the end nothing does. 
Once the land is ours, we can start getting the infrastructure in place, and every year it will be easier. We're doing this not just for women, but specifically for radical feminists. This is your place if you want it to be.
I hope you'll all consider coming. The event is what we collectively make of it. Headliners are the incomparable Dominique Christina and Max Dashu, plus a pile of other brave and fabulous women.

douhn78,marriedredpill,"&gt; the effort to turn the relationship around.

Red Pill 101 for the uninitiated:  **MEN FIX THEMSELVES.  WOMEN FIX THE RELATIONSHIP.**

Let's just say, for a minute, that I took your ""is it worth the effort, though"" question seriously.  And also, let's say that, for a divine moment in time, I knew the answer.  And I told you, in my great wisdom, that it was ***not*** worth it.  That this woman is always going to be boneheaded, stubborn, refuse your leadership, refuse to fuck you the way you want, etc.

Would you stop improving?

Because you are implying that you would.  And that's the weakness that has us hurling on the floor.

&gt; wasting effort in a lost woman

You're a fool.  You think I put any effort into my wife?  You think I try to make her happy?  Figure out what she's thinking or what she wants?  You think that's what MRP is all about?  How to make women happy?  And if this woman can't be made happy, you want to know ASAP so you can stop focusing on her?

You should NEVER be focused on her.

&gt; guys in a DB are in it with a woman not good enough

Here's my point: if you're in a DB, you have no clue if the problem is you or her.  But because you're a weak fuck who doesn't know his own ass from a hole in the ground, you think it's probably her.

Listen you disrespectful cunt of a man, your initial comment added nothing to the conversation except your own chin beard stroking, puffing on your pipe, and pondering the great mysteries of life.

I thought my wife was the problem too.  I even posted about it in a glorious victim puke, looking for a scapegoat because focusing on myself was *haaaaaaarrrrrrrrrdddd*.  ""What if I'm improving myself for *NOTHING*, guise???  What if this relationship is just too far gone and I could be out there slaying strange pussy right now???  What am I possibly missing out on???  Just tell me if it's going to work out, and I'll know then.""

&gt; I am not saying don't improve yourself

But why are you improving in the first place?  To save a relationship?

&gt; I am not saying don't try to save any kind of relationship

Confirms your reasoning.  Don't do MRP for a relationship.

&gt; I am not saying women are not worth it

They're not.  You are.  In theory anyway.

&gt; I am not saying don't put any effort

Again, effort into what?  Into yourself or the relationship?  Or is your self esteem too nebulous to be separated from whatever current relationship you have?  In which case, there's a support group for codependents, sorta like Alcoholics Anonymous.  I can hook you up if you have a hard time googling.","""MEN FIX THEMSELVES. WOMEN FIX THE RELATIONSHIP.""

efui91v,marriedredpill,"MRP takes months if not years. 

Perhaps the wife was noticing something was going on early and reacted, but in the end her muscle memory on old ways is stronger. 

The point is, give her new muscle memory on how things are going to be. That takes a long time. Lead, lift and stfu long enough for it to be the new norm. That’s when the pendulum starts to swing. That’s when you’ve made it clear that the new “you” is here to stay for good. 

Even then.... as outlined in TWOTSM  “Stop Hoping for Your Woman to Get Easier”. It wont, but you can certainly set positive trends that become more of the norm. Do it for yourself in the end. ","I spent a lot of time (too much) trying to figure this out.  From my end, when the rope tugged, I was unprepared and showed a serious lack of leadership and self belief. I tried not to dwell too much on what her thinking on this was, but the muscle memory idea seems perfectly valid.. and therefor makes sense that any real change didn't kick in until I started believing in myself and really started to do it for myself.

60amaq,fPUA,"From accidentally suave to giggling dork, I am completely clueless I'm hoping to get advice on how to act when actually attracted to someone. Yes, general and broad question, I know, but I don't mean it that way.

See, apparently I'm very attractive. Apparently lots of people have crushes on me at once. I never notice.
Apparently I flirt with people who I shouldn't, such as underage young teens (oops, wow), because apparently I am a very flirty person. I never notice. 
Apparently I can suavely seduce any guy who is into girls and make them totally obsessed with me without even trying - or noticing! 

It's a problem.

Not the problem I want to ask about, though.

So all that was preface more or less to say that I accidentally and cluelessly am good at this stuff when I don't want to be, but when I want to be, it's an entirely different story. I may not notice anything, but everyone else sure does once I like someone. Oh, I think I keep it hidden, but from the staring and the awkward laughter and the constantly talking about him and hanging out where I know he hangs out and nervously asking to hang out and then smiling like an idiot when he says yes, I am once again completely and totally unaware of any of this behavior. Others are not. Others see. Others know. 

Shit. 

So, uhhh, how do I act less clueless? How do I be more discreet when I like people and not look like a total schoolgirl dork? Taking notice of my own actions and all that? Because like every other time in my life, I am unperceptive and confused. ","I mean if it's not causing you any issues I don't think you really need to change your behavior. Sure, trying to relax a little bit more and playing it cool is good, but personally I like it when a girl is obviously into me even if she acts a little goofy. It's cute

I'm using an alt account. 

I usually lurk and participate using my main account here.  I have decided to use an alternate one simply for self-preservation.

It always amazed me on the long lists of requirements women have for men, yet how short they come when it's about fulfilling our requirements.

**Men need to be**

* Good Looking
* Good physical condition
* Have a certain height
* Make good money
* Be giving and loving
* Show emotions
* Not show emotions
* Never get sick or otherwise be vulnerable
* Be handy around the house
* Be available of their time yet
* Need to work many hours to provide
* Yet still be available on a whim
* Not have too many passions and hobbies that takes away time from her
* Yet be passionate and happy to be alive.
* Never raise their voice
* Never be angry or not take responsibility for her fickleness
* Be decisive
* But not take offense when she bitches about said decision or outright refuses
* 6/6/6 (ie: 6 inches, 6 figures, 6 foot tall)

etc ... etc ... etc


Women on the other hand ... we don't have that crazy standards.

**We basically want 4 things from you**

* Be relatively fit, ie: not be obese, and certainly not be morbidly obese
* Be of good demeanor (ie: not be cunts at least 50% of the time)
* Be sexually available and willing, regularly
* Be grateful

Girls, if you satisfy 3 of the 4 above points, men will virtually be your slaves forever.

Yet, my ex-wife of ten years ago, all the 30 or so dates I have had since and the 3 LTRs that came out of those that I have since let go, none of you could even do one of these four things consistently.

Don't you realize how fucking stupid you are?

* If a girl is fit, good attitude, grateful but not that good in bed =&gt; Still winning
* If a girl is overweight, good attitude, good in bed, grateful =&gt; Still winning
* If a girl is fit, bad attitude, but still occasionally grateful, good in bed =&gt; still winning
* If a girl is fit, good attitude, seldom grateful, good in bed =&gt; still winning.


Why is it so FUCKING HARD to deliver on even 2 of these items?

Yet we men are expected to satisfy a gagglefuck list of items on your cheklist all the time.

And then you idiots wonder ""where have all the good men gone""?

3uyxwd,jerktalkdiamond,My experience at Black Lives Matter protest in Minneapolis [removed],"**Good Guy YellowFrog593**

&gt;* My experience at Black Lives Matter protest in Minneapolis

&gt;* On November 15th, Jamar Clark was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer. According to the Minneapolis Police Department, Clark had assaulted his girlfriend before turning on the paramedics attending her injuries. When police arrived to intervene, Clark is believed to have attacked the officers and gained possession of one of their firearms. According to these officers, Clark was holding this weapon when one of them shot and killed him. They claim the act was one of self-defense. However, according to protesters affiliated with Black Lives Matter, Jamar was unarmed and in handcuffs at the time he was shot. Black Lives Matter protesters believe that the shooting was unnecessary and unjustified, and in fact an act of racism, not self defense. They claim it was murder.

Since the shooting, members and supporters of Black Lives Matter have been camped on Plymouth Avenue, outside the Fourth Precinct, with the purported intent of protesting Clark’s death and pressuring the Minneapolis Police Department into releasing video footage of the moment he died, as well as arresting the two police officers who Black Lives Matter protesters feel are responsible. They claim their protest is peaceful.

On November 19th, I made plans with some friends to attend the protest. Our intent was to observe and live stream. The following day, November 20th, I went to the protest with the intent of meeting up with these friends. I wore a partial face mask — the kind that snowboarders and skiers wear on cold days, the kind that only covers the wearer's mouth and nose. While my friends and I intended to remain peaceful and did not bring weapons, and while the protesters claimed to be non-violent, I still wanted to play it safe. I was aware that protesters do not always take kindly to being recorded, and it was for this reason I did not wish to be identified. It also occurred to me that I may fit in more with the protesters due to the fact that masks are common attire at most protests. Armed with only my phone and a few energy bars, I set out.

Upon arriving alone at the protest a few minutes before 6:00PM, I was immediately approached by a protester. He introduced himself as Tyrone and asked if I was there to take part in the protest. I told him the honest truth: that I was there to observe the protest and see what was going on but not to take part. He seemed content with this and returned to the street to resume protesting. He appeared to me to be a respectful man with good intentions.

Momentarily thereafter, a female protester — I do not know her name, so we'll call her Anna — approached me. She, too, asked why I was there. I gave her the same answer that I had given Tyrone. She wasn't as satisfied as Tyrone had been. She asked me if I was there to cause trouble and claimed that other people had shown up to cause trouble (which may or may not be true). I believe that she singled out me specifically because of my race. Nearly every protester there was black, and Anna — who appeared to be a Middle Eastern or southwest Asian woman in her early 20s — was one of the few exceptions, so I, a white man, stood out. I assured her that I was not there to cause trouble, only to observe. While she didn't seem satisfied with my answer, she nonetheless walked away and rejoined the other protesters.

I then walked along the sidewalk beside the protest, looking for the friends who I had intended to meet up with. When I had been there only a few minutes, while walking along the sidewalk and keeping to myself, I was approached by another protester who asked why I was there. Again, I can only assume that I was singled out because of my race. I told him the same thing I had told Anna and Tyrone, and then immediately another protester — a fairly tall and slender black man who appeared to be in his 20s or 30s — approached and grabbed me without provocation. He demanded to know what I was doing there. I politely told him to take his hands off me. He refused and pushed me into a parking lot. He continued to demand to know why I was there and what I had brought with me. I answered his questions honestly: that I was there to peacefully observe and that I was looking for my friends. He began to feel my pockets and demanded to know what the objects he felt were. I answered honestly again: my phone and the energy bars I brought with me. While normally in such a situation I would have pushed away the attacker and left as quickly as possible, in this instance I knew that I was surrounded by a few hundred protesters who would probably take the aggressor's side, so I didn't want to appear to fight him or resist. I hope he would leave me alone if I cooperated.

My answers didn't satisfy him. While interrogating me, he attempted to throw me into a portable toilet, which I avoided. He then pushed me further into the parking lot, out of sight of the other protesters. I believe that he wanted to get me away from witnesses to allow him to injure me — or worse. If he only wanted to interrogate me, he could have easily done that on the sidewalk where I had been standing. Fortunately for me, a group of other people followed. One of them was recording the incident but quickly stopped. I assume that he stopped recording as to avoid implicating my assailant. I make that assumption because one of the protesters, who goes by ""Unicorn Riot,"" has been known to employ such tactics when streaming the protest. He has openly admitted that this is to avoid getting protesters in trouble.

While being on video did not deter the man that assaulted me, one of the protesters who had followed into the parking lot came to my defense, telling the man who assaulted me that it was a peaceful protest and demanding that he stop. The attacker then turned his attention from me to the other protester and began arguing. Anna — the woman who had questioned me right when I arrived — came over and took the side of the man who had assaulted me. While they were arguing with each other, I left the parking lot and returned to the sidewalk. I believed that I was safe, having gotten away from the attacker and back in view of a lot of people. However, a group of protesters followed me, with one of them yelling to the other protesters to watch me. I walked down the sidewalk and they followed. A girl — in her teens, short and chubby — was the most adamant about following me. She got in front of me, and when I turned away from her, she re-positioned herself to remain in front of me, apparently attempting to prevent me from going anywhere. Paradoxically, she demanded that I leave, and — without any apparent basis for her claim aside from the fact that I am a white man — called me racist. I politely told her that I was not racist and that I was on public property and had the right to be there. I politely said that I was there to observe and see what was going on, and that I should be welcome there, given that the whole point of protests is to raise awareness and inform people about the cause. She said that I should leave and watch a live stream instead. It was then I realized that this protest was different from most other protests. At every other protest I have attended, the protesters were happy to talk to bystanders and inform them about their cause. The girl ended up accepting that I remain there but said that I would be watched closely.

Immediately after that conversation, throughout which I spoke politely and respectfully, a black man — a big guy, heavy but not fat, tall and without much hair, probably in his 20s or 30s — confronted me and demanded that I remove my mask.  Apparently he didn't approve of a white man peacefully observing the protest. Keeping my mask on was now more important to me than ever because the protesters had already demonstrated animosity towards me, and I was concerned that if they learned my identity, they would attempt to find me later. I also didn't want to argue with the man. I wanted to avoid confrontation. Telling him that I would not remove the mask seemed like a bad idea. My only course of action, therefore, was to turn away and try to avoid him. However, as soon as I did that, a few protesters — at least two, maybe more — grabbed me. One, I believe it was the same man who had demanded that I remove my mask, grabbed my upper body by my shoulders. Another grabbed my leg. They threw me to the ground. A group of protesters surrounded me, got on top of me, and attempted to search my pockets. I grabbed my phone in my pocket, partly so it would not fall out and partly so they would not take it. They asked what it was and I told them that it was a phone. I said I would leave the protest if they got off of me and let me go. They tried to reach into my pocket to grab my phone and one of them claimed it was a gun. I held onto it and one of them was able to feel it and determine that it was indeed a phone. He then told the others that it was indeed a phone. I don't know if they legitimately thought it was a gun and only sought to confirm that it was a phone or if they intended to take my phone from me. However, when they learned that it was a phone, they let up somewhat. I managed to get up. I don't know if they intentionally let me get up or unintentionally let up enough for me to get up.

As soon as I was on my feet I went back to the sidewalk and began walking away from the protest. Despite the fact that I had remained peaceful and not intentionally provoked the protesters or harmed anyone in any way, and despite the fact that I was on public property and had the right to be there, it was clear that I was unwelcome there. By remaining there any longer I would be in significant danger. As I walked away from the protest, a group of a dozen or so protesters followed. I moved even closer to the road, walking right alongside the curb, believing that being in view of car drivers would keep the pr",0

Nazis were actually quite efficient at killing Jews, many were killed by just being shot and being filled in, that was their funeral. There were versions of Zyklon-B without a smell - when they noticed that they were being gassed, it was too late to do anything.

Holocaust deniers are deluded. There was no photoshop back then, no Photoshop CS or image-editing software. However, there were mass graves, and no one is going to pretend to be a dead inmate of a camp, or an emaciated inmate. ","I used to buy into it the death camps. I used to just think ""Holocaust didn't happen"" was a funny way to rustle jimmies. Now though, after bothering to learn more (and being neutral, I didn't care if it happened or not), there's just NO WAY the official narrative isn't an extreme exaggeration, filled with many specific details which are outright lies. It's how you should make a lie: with truth sprinkled in. 

Read original documents and transcripts, not Jewish propaganda, and you'll see. Or go watch One Third of the Holocaust, and sit back while someone does it for you. It's unbelievable the garbage that passes for evidence for the official narrative.

Jews were specifically targeted, rightly, and concentration camps were real. ""Death camps"" with mass, *indiscriminate* exterminations however DID NOT HAPPEN. Ovens and gas chambers are FICTION.

There appears to have been agreement between Hitler and Himmler that Soviet Jews were to be considered as one of those population groups which opposed the Germans and was engaging in partisan warfare behind the German lines, and therefore needed to be wiped out.

Any massive-scale shooting of non-Soviet Jews was also not initiated by a specific order given by Hitler, but was the result of a series of local decisions by German commanders in the field and in occupied territories, reacting to local problems of food supply and other vital resources. The only active killing of non-Soviet Jews ever mentioned by Hitler was the shooting of those who were able-bodied but ""refused to work"", i.e. actively resisted.

&gt;emaciated inmate.

That doesn't set off an alarm in your head? Why would they keep this guy around long enough to become emaciated, if they were just going to gas or burn him in some fancy industrialized execution factory?

A crazy fucking scheme that gave the Allies license to take anything from Germany, and Jews to milk for 70 years now with no sign of letting up.

bea4t1,Ask_Radical_Feminists,"Aliens and Gender Hi everyone!

My question is addressed to anyone who thinks gender is a matter of biology; that whether a person is a man or a woman depends solely on some facts about their current or natal genitals, chromosomes, etc. Thanks in advance for reading!

Suppose that some aliens land on earth tomorrow. They look and act a lot like us. 

They are physically dimorphic. One group has the characteristics that men commonly have: they are on average taller, hairier, etc. The other group has the characteristics that women commonly have. Walking down the street, you wouldn’t be able to tell these aliens apart from a human. 

Their social structure is a lot like contemporary American society. Their language distinguishes between these groups through titles (like Mr. and Ms.). Historically, one group has been disenfranchised. Members of each group are likely to experience different benefits and burdens based on their group membership, etc. In short, they’ve got something recognizably similar to contemporary American social structures around gender. 

However, their biology is radically different from ours. They have no genitals or chromosomes. They reproduce by magic. They have no gametes, so neither group produces larger gametes. 

Are these aliens men and women? For instance, if their monarch looked like a woman, would you use feminine titles (e.g. “Queen of the Aliens”) and pronouns to talk about that person? How would you decide which resources and spaces they have access to?","Dealing in hypotheticals is a waste of time. No, they aren't men and women, they are a completely different species. Men are adult human males and women are adult human females. Since they are not human, they do not meet the criteria.",0

""are you saying that by focusing on the ways that women are structurally victimized, feminists are erasing and censoring male victims of the same structures?""

Actually I'm saying much more than that.  I'm saying that the near universal erasure of male victims is a form of structural victimisation of men.  Gynocentric feminists didn't invent this structure, but they benefit from it, and they uphold it.

I'm not saying that the erasure of male victims is a necessary consenquence of focussing on female victims.  It's possible to focus on female victims without erasing male victims and vice versa.

fxirr1m,Intactivists,"A long and prosperous misinformation campaign that has happened over generations. 
The popularization in the U.S started with John Harvey Kellogg a puritan who believed that flavorful foods lead to lustful thoughts. He experimented on people in his asylum. He presented circumcision as a cure for many things, from homosexuality to masturbation. He also promoted allying acid to the clitoris. 
In the 80s it became much more popular again as part of the aids crisis, this is where a lot of the medical claims come from.
And now it's a social norm. Along with other forms of genital alterations usually done to intersex people.
The U.S likes to act like it's above things like this but it's not.
And yet people in the U.S look down on other cultures for doing things like had tattoos or ear piercings. And yet alerting genitals is treated as just fine. It's messed up","Jesus, I looked that guy up and he sounds almost like Hitler. But besides, I just struggle to understand why people aren’t appalled by circumcision. I don’t know why my parents decided not to circumcise me, but maybe the fact that they don’t agree with altering a baby’s genitals for no reason had something to do with it? And the whole reducing cancer risk argument: why don’t we just cut off legs and arms to reduce bone and skin cancers? Someone can’t be outraged by FGM but be fine with MGM - I get some forms of FGM are more severe but there’s no reason why genitals need to be altered if there is no issue with them. I just get mad because I saw someone posted on their Insta story an anti-FGM poster. While that is certainly important, getting rid of MGM is also a good idea and you can’t ignore the fact that every year millions of men have their genitals mutilated without their consent. 

Let’s just say I felt almost a sense of pride when I took sex Ed in 8th grade and the teacher mentioned that in was probable that few of the boys in class had a foreskin. I’m in the US so it isn’t surprising. And to be honest, I kind of hate the religious Argument that Yahweh or Allah or God wanted people to circumcise for the covenant. If you use religious arguments to justify mild FGM, suddenly you become a mutilator. We need to see a baby’s circumcised dick as abnormal before this changes. If a man wants to be circumcised as an adult, that is his choice. But shame on the parents who say their son needs to be circumcised - obviously consent isn’t important to them.",0

I know you have posted a lot and I took a lot of time to write this so please read it thoroughly, when I was in your situation I wished I had got this message. You can downvote if you want but you need to read this.

**Being attractive is** **not** **about looking one way or another.** Attraction is about how you make people around you feel, how you *attract* them to you. It's an active process. You don't just sit on a bar stool and wait for the fellows to line up.

I used to think if I lost weight and looked like \[insert popular celebrity here\] I would be the life of the party, have lots of friends, and everything would be right in the world. I did lose the weight. I got braces. I started doing my hair and dressing better and doing my nails.  I got into a top school and got a good job. By all measures, I was a ""catch""- but I  didn't have any big party invites, no lineup of gentleman callers, just a small group of friends. Know why?

**Because my attitude and social skills hadn't improved.** Being overweight before wasn't the issue, feeling uncomfortable and awkward in my own skin because I wasn't taking care of myself was.  I didn't have cool hobbies to share, or interests outside of netflix and hitting up the occasional bar. I didn't put myself out there, and I looked unapproachable and I hadn't developed myself enough to feel confident that I had something to share or offer to others.

It sounds like your sister is more outgoing, and that may be why she's getting more attention. Yes, looks are important on a superficial level, and yes it's flattering,but it gets very old very fast. If you don't have any substance to back it up all you'll end up with is a bunch of douches vying for ONS.

**What do** ***you*** **have to offer? What makes you fun, interesting, or special? What are some topics that make you light up about? Play that shit up and own it. Focus on that and attraction and confidence will come to you later naturally.**

That was the turning point for me. Now I focus a lot on my own interests, I have an active personal life that is intriguing to others and satisfying to me. I travel as much as I can, I have a good job that I enjoy, I take care of myself, and I have plenty to talk about. I did a two month trip to Europe this year,  I learned how to ride a motorcycle, I skateboard, I go to lots of shows and I have people over to my house (which I keep clean, comfortable, and welcoming) for potluck dinners that everyone enjoys and wants to be a part of (because I took the time to learn how to cook). I am outgoing, I listen to others, and I always smile and introduce myself when I meet someone new.

None of that just happened and none of it has anything to do with being pretty. I get hit on a lot and it's because of how i make people feel, they want to be around me because I work hard to be the person others want to be around. I am not boasting, I know these are facts because I have put in a lot of time and effort to come out of my shell and find these things that I like doing and to make it so.

Having geeky interests isn't a problem, eventually you'll see those are all just a bunch of made up judgments anyway. It's part of you so play it up. I was into biblical anointing oils for awhile but I would light up when I talked about them so people listened. When you light up, others will too. An average girl who is it lit up is more attractive than a conventionally pretty girl with a scowl. Right now you need to build up yourself so you know what those things are and can develop them. This is an absolute imperative that extends far beyond hooking up, you need to know this so you can be fulfilled in yourself, for yourself, and will help immensely as you get older.

I can go on forever about this but it is such a huge topic there's no way I could do it in one reddit post. There's a great book called ""The New Rules of Attraction"" by Arden Leigh and it helped me a lot. I think when you start to understand what attraction is really about this will be much easier for you. Your sister isn't the issue, she is just bringing the issue to the surface. I know this sucks right now but if you go about it the right way you will learn invaluable lessons that will take you down a beautiful path.

Ultimately you're the one driving this train and if you want things to change to you have to change them. Nobody can help you if you aren't going out to help yourself. Good luck to you and feel free to ask if you have any questions. xo","Preach sista!

The Soviets *were not* communist, the workers never owned the means of production, it was at best an authoritarian capitalist hellscape, and so using the methods they used as an example is disingenuous at best. 

As you correctly pointed out, Marx called religion the 'opiate of the people' because at the time it was used by the churches of the largest denominations to tell the poor that although they suffered now, they should be content so they would be rewarded in heaven. Some denominations still do this, but the idea of religion is not considered an opiate on its own to any leftists I know personally.

Also, yes, the fact that it's harder for a rich man to enter heaven than a camel to go through the eye of a needle is exactly what was said in the Bible, but I'd ask you to think more analytically about why it is that being rich and going into heaven is nearly (or perhaps fully, depending on how you interpret the metaphor) impossible for a rich man. Is it because rich men become rich because they are attached to money, or because they somehow become rich by accident and then become attached to money?

Christ teaches that human suffering is unjust, and that causing it goes against the will of God, so are hoarders of wealth going against the will of God by allowing their fortunes to become more important than human suffering? I'd argue so, and I don't see much of an argument against it.

This is a very interesting discussion, so thanks for replying, most right wing subs ban me because their ideas don't stand up to the scrutiny of others.","Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.

How hard it is to understand gender is not only a social construct but also something similar to sexual orientation ?

Archaeologists seem pretty set on female fertility to be associated with the Venus objects found dating back to 20 thousand years ago (if i remember correctly) but male penis size I have seen pop up (no pun intended) here and there. I see in TV shows about rome in fact I think it was called Rome a young man being introduced to brothels, but do not know where in ancient writings penis size comes up. When I think about Greek statues I do not remember these men looking like real studs too often, and a few vases just seem to have penises everywhere. I know that middle ages and the comedia del arte shows lots of penis humour as does shakespeare. 

I guess it is interesting to think about penis size in time and space IMO and where maybe the myth of the large penis being more pleasurable began, or whether it ever really was a thing pre 1950/1960

fqsgni6,AskThe_Donald,"Can I ask you a question about this? Specifically your thoughts on my opinion of the trade war? My stance is that Trump's trade decisions have reduced America's domination of global trade and just gave it to China. The reason why is because Trump runs the country like a business, but China runs their country for geopolitical domination. There are few major reasons why I believe this. 

1) Trump has put a great deal of effort into seeding distrust into the government and media. At times he is correct, liberal news can be sensationalized and their hatred towards him is often blinding. But rather than bridging the divide he has found 'triggering the libs' more enjoyable than finding common ground. I think the ensuing scandals, his fault or not, and his tweeting have taken up entire segments of the evening news and distracted from major geopolitical plays made by China under his nose. For example, their increased military presence (and for the first time ever new military bases in key trade locations) which barely even hit the news because every channel was obsessed with the funny man with blonde hair. 

2) During Trump's tenure, he ran on a incoherent policy of returning to the old world order of American isolationism and self-sufficiency. China would love nothing more than to return to the old world where it was the centre of geopolitical dominance and America wasn't included. Trump just... gave it to them. This is why I think that:

A) Trump pulled out of the Trans Pacific partnership, which gave China an opportunity to expand its influence of the Pacific. The Chinese inserted themselves into leading the negotiation for new trade treaties without ANY  Americans at the table, which is unheard of. Then at the World Economic Forum, an event hosted for the elites of global capitalism, the president of the Chinese communist state was the opening speaker. China actually lectured to the world on how to do better free trade and how his Nation would now take a leading position, while America wasn't even present.

B) Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods. Chinese goods became more expensive in the US (paid largely for by American consumers in higher prices, but reduced their demand). However, China just sold those goods to Africa at less of a cost in favour of increased relations and resources, it didn't even bump their production. But what's worse is that Chinese were still selling the same products to consumers in the United States anyway, by developing a new relationship with Vietnam and Malaysia. China would send them a 90% completed product, finish the 10%, and call it ""not made in China""; Vietnam and Malaysia previously had much stronger ties to the United States and we're wary of China (because of history), the agreement incentivize them to develop stronger economic relationship at the cost of American relations. Trump KNEW about the loophole, because it's something the US uses all the time. Cars are built to 90% completion in Mexico and shipped to the US and called ""made in USA"". Plus a million other examples to get cheaper labour, I won't bore you by listing) 

C) China has developed a lucrative trade relationship with pretty much the entirety of Africa, while trump called them shit holes and diminished America's own influence in the region from a policy perspective. Now we left Africa alone because of dictatorships etc, but they are more than happy to give China all their resources so China can produce stuff and sell it back to them. 

D) Trump then imposed tariffs on India for aluminium... The ONLY real local competitor with China for trade domination in the region. India has been increasingly cut off by the systematic building of ports by China across the middle East and africa (by lending money, them defaulting, then having to give them prime location for a China soverign port). Instead of stengthing India, he just weakened them further for no real geopolitical purpose other than a political image to his voters.

E) Trump's is hated. Like truely hated on a global scale by other world leaders. They see him as unstable and unreliable. Members of the EU have publicly stressed the economic certainty of China is more attractive than the US. They also have been bailed out by China (e.g., esp Portugal and Greece) which has influenced policy decisions that diminish the criticism of China's human rights problems and also diminish the influence of the US (not Trump's fault there). Don't even get me started on what they did to Australia... 

F) my country, Canada, Trump has reared his trade wars on and became economically unpredictable even to us. First he tried to fuck us on NAFTA for a public win, which was minor in terms of gains. During COVID trump told our ONLY DISTRIBUTOR OF N95s to stop shipping them to us, even though it's something that we are so desperately low on. Despite us being literally are 3Ms only supply of that type of pulp, he still tried to fuck us.  Who was there when we scrambled? Yes. China. In fact China, despite being the epicentre of all this, has been dishing out economic support to countries since this started. Again strengthening geopolitical dominance while Trump flounders to just sort out his country. 

China has wanted to topple US global trade domination since they came out of that terrible famine and looked back at their old world history. And I sincerely believe Trump alone hastened it significantly.

TL;DR [this video](https://youtu.be/hhMAt3BluAU) is far more interesting than my wall of text I just spent forever on. It also explains it alot better. 

ALSO, I'm actually interested in your opinion. There is no attempt, on my part, to convince or dismiss. I'm genuinely curious what you think. I prefer political policy over political theatre. I just sincerely have never had the chance to ask a Trump support why.","&gt; Can I ask you a question about this? Specifically your thoughts on my opinion of the trade war? My stance is that Trump's trade decisions have reduced America's domination of global trade and just gave it to China. The reason why is because Trump runs the country like a business, but China runs their country for geopolitical domination. There are few major reasons why I believe this.

That assessment is wrong. China is entirely dependent on the rest of the world or they starve. If they do not expand, they collapse from the inside out. This is what happens when you build a country up from the top-down. The States is built exactly opposite of that.

&gt; 1) Trump has put a great deal of effort into seeding distrust into the government and media. At times he is correct, liberal news can be sensationalized and their hatred towards him is often blinding. But rather than bridging the divide he has found 'triggering the libs' more enjoyable than finding common ground.

For example, their increased military presence (and for the first time ever new military bases in key trade locations) which barely even hit the news because every channel was obsessed with the funny man with blonde hair.

The establishment and the media is not on our side and they never have or will ever be. They can choose, right now, to ignore the president and focus on China, but they would rather run interference for them and spread their propaganda. Trump is 100% right in declaring them the enemy of the people. It goes beyond just ""triggering the libs"", it's about opening our eyes to something that should not exist: media orgs more interesting in sucking off career politicians than actually reporting the news. Everything they do is a complete joke and rightly deserve everything they are getting and more. They should be burned down and an actual honest press should be taking their place. 

&gt; 2) During Trump's tenure, he ran on a incoherent policy of returning to the old world order of American isolationism and self-sufficiency. China would love nothing more than to return to the old world where it was the centre of geopolitical dominance and America wasn't included. Trump just... gave it to them. This is why I think that:

America First does not mean American Only. China is as only as strong as we let them. Their military is a complete joke and their only real strength is within their borders. They do not have a navy or air force that could ever hope to match ours. We have complete domination over the land, sea, air and now space. Our economic might is even more powerful. We do not have to fire a shot to bring down entire countries. China was getting their asses handed to them over the trade war and they sought to end all of that by releasing the Kung Flu. This was an obvious mistake because not only have they royally pissed us off, they've angered the world, increasing their coming isolation.

&gt; A) Trump pulled out of the Trans Pacific partnership, which gave China an opportunity to expand its influence of the Pacific. The Chinese inserted themselves into leading the negotiation for new trade treaties without ANY Americans at the table, which is unheard of. Then at the World Economic Forum, an event hosted for the elites of global capitalism, the president of the Chinese communist state was the opening speaker. China actually lectured to the world on how to do better free trade and how his Nation would now take a leading position, while America wasn't even present.

The TPP would have given what China was lecturing about and we ended that and brought them to their knees with the trade war.

&gt; B) Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods. Chinese goods became more expensive in the US (paid largely for by American consumers in higher prices, but reduced their demand). However, China just sold those goods to Africa at less of a cost in favour of increased relations and resources, it didn't even bump their production.

Plus a million other examples to get cheaper labour, I won't bore you by listing)

Africa is a sunk cost and an act of pure desperation. With this blundered attempt to bring the world's economies to their knees, the release of the virus galvanized the world against China and now companies are seeking to return manufacturing to their home countries and isolating China form the world, as they deserve. 

&gt; C) China has developed a lucrative trade relationship with pretty much the entirety of Africa, while trump called them shit holes and diminished America's own influence in the region from a policy perspective. Now we left Africa alone because of dictatorships etc, but they are more than happy to give China all their resources so China can produce stuff and sell it back to them.

Let them bankrupt themselves on a worthless continent. They will learn the same lessons we had to learn by fucking around in the 3rd world. 

&gt; D) Trump's is hated. Like truely hated on a global scale by other world leaders. They see him as unstable and unreliable. Members of the EU have publicly stressed the economic certainty of China is more attractive than the US. They also have been bailed out by China (e.g., esp Portugal and Greece) which has influenced policy decisions that diminish the criticism of China's human rights problems and also diminish the influence of the US (not Trump's fault there). Don't even get me started on what they did to Australia...

Globalists will be globalists. I would be more worried if they all liked him. His universal hatred by spineless politicians means he's doing just fine.

Your glorious leader refused to even show up for the talks and instead of playing his game, Trump went ahead and made the deals anyways.

I was seeing a woman for over three years and the relationship was quite intense; her, her friends and her family all thought that I was the model boyfriend and everything seemed great. It looked like we would end up getting hitched. In the third year of the relationship, I started noticing some toxic and manipulative behavior that I had not opened my eyes to earlier.

I thought of myself as a one-woman kind of a man and felt quite secure and satisfied with that until all hell broke loose.

czkky3d,Gender_Critical,"&gt;In all seriousness, curious how people feel here about females in women's prisons on testosterone, given evidence that it increases violent crime rate    

It says that criminality rises after full transition. As in, after surgeries and numerous years of transition. Although I agree that testosterone heightens your likelihood to commit violent crimes. I've been on testosterone, you're more react violently on it, especially if you don't know how to control yourself. 

However, it's also important to realize that the trans community breeds violence because of many other reasons. The community itself used to (and still does in someways) push harmful gender roles on trans men. It tells them they need to mimic toxic masculinity. After years of internalizing these messages in the hope that they'll be like ""real men"", it's no wonder they're more likely to commit violence. There's also the fact that trans men are commonly CSA victims, rape victims. Therefore more likely to be ill, more likely to be poor. Which heightens the likelyhood that they'll end up lashing out in a violent way. 

This person is young, they've not been on hormones long, not been indoctrinated for long. I don't think they're anymore likely to be a threat to the female prison population than a non-trans female who had higher than normal testosterone. ","Thanks for your perspective.

I have been planning some fairly big things. One of these things would benefit from your help.

I am seeking citations for peer-reviewed studies, published in respected journals, that do one or more of the following:

* Demonstrate or strongly imply correlations between race/ethnicity and cognitive abilities, whether physical (e.g., brain size or cranial capacity), mental (IQ), or social/behavioral (different actions taken by human subjects from the same stimulus);

* Serve to refute the claim that racial and ethnic diversity and multiculturalism are beneficial for societies;

* Challenge commonly accepted beliefs regarding race and history (e.g., slavery being primarily a practice among white people, American Indians being the first to colonize North America, etc.);

* Challenge commonly accepted notions about white people being privileged, especially among historically white countries (e.g., whites receiving better treatment from law enforcement officers and the judicial system, whites being favored for jobs over minorities).

If you know of any such studies, please post a link to their abstracts or, failing that, citations to them in any format. I will handle the rest myself. Thank you in advance for your assistance.

http://weburbanist.com/2010/11/07/political-animal-the-ever-evolving-republican-elephant-logo/

A curious point in the Republican Elephant’s evolution occurred in the (presidential election) year 2000, just prior to the first year of George W. Bush’s administration. With virtually no notice and little if any subsequent explanation, the 3 stars in the GOP Elephant logo were inverted so that they now stood points down. The law concerning “Respect For The Flag”, US Code Title 4 Section 8(a), reads “The flag should never be displayed with the union (the stars represent the union of the states) down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.”","You answered your own question.  The Bush crime family stole the election, participated in a false flag attack to illicit authorization to begin another illegal war, and proceeded to collude with big business and big banks to steal your property and life.

dy6nljs,aznidentity,"TL;DR: Asians are in a lose-lose position because of how whites are treated in Asian countries and how the anti-Asian sentiment carries over to Western countries.

Hi, first time here.

I don't really understand how Twitter works since the reply chains seem to be so... disorderly, but what I have seem to make sense of is how the arrogance of the posters is profoundly disturbing to me.

I think at the end of it all... Asians in the Western world will always get the short end of the stick *because* of how the Western world will never get off its high horse, and their tactics of using wisecracks against us only proves how prideful they are for themselves, of themselves.

That being said, I think it goes both ways. Whites within Asian countries, particularly Mainland China will decry of the discriminatory way that they are treated in China, and it serves only a disservice to Asians in the West as expats living in Asian countries relay these sentiments to the people living in the West.","If you read it, these people purposely go out of their way to explicitly be racist.

cfwrrud,becomeaman,So then why are bodybuilders bigger? ,"Simple, bodybuilders intentionally use less efficient movements and don't train for CNS efficiency. A power lifter is training for maximal CNS efficiency because they have to compete in a weight class, so the lower their muscle mass per kg lifted the better. A bodybuilder wants to be inefficient because then the only way to get stronger is by building more muscle mass to cope with the weight. There really isn't a huge difference and if you look at the strongest lifters out there, most could easily get their pro card in bodybuilding. 

I think the main notable difference is that because of the difference between bodybuilding and powerlifting styles there is a difference in the rep ranges lifters can hit. Say a bodybuilder and a powerlifter go head to head in a rep out and they both have the same 1rm, the bodybuilder is probably going to smoke the powerlifter. Conversely, if they both have the same best rep out and go for a 1rm, the powerlifter is probably going to hit a significantly higher 1rm.",0

782okl,askseddit,"Date 1 went well, how do i make her my FWB? I went on a tinderdate with this girl and it went well. We had lots of laughs, fluent conversations, did some light kino and even ended up at her place. Though i did not escalate on her in her appartement, she didn't really give me any openings or hints. I don't think i'm in the wrong for not escalating, if she wanted it she would have hinted towards it. We were playing with her dog almost the whole time there.

I'd like to make her my FWB. I enjoy spending time with her (as a friend) and she's really open about sex. Said herself: ""If i want sex, i just go for it, i don't care what others think."". I haven't suggested an FWB relationship to her though, and i don't know if i should (yet). I don't think she's looking for something serious either.

When/how do i set up date 2? Date happened last thursday and we kept our chats very brief. She was recently operated and will have a sore throat for 1-2 weeks. Thing is, she's not very chatty at all, so it's hard for me to know where i stand. Plus, these tinder girls are flaky af and probably has 2138198 guys lined up. Although i can say for sure we both enjoyed the time we spent together. Today i wished her a fast recovery and left it at that. When should i text again? When should i ask for date 2? ","&gt;I don't think i'm in the wrong for not escalating

You were. If you want an FWB, you have to be unashamed about your desires and honest with yourself. Not escalating when you're back home with her is the opposite of that. You're acting like you want a *friend* without the benefits. 

&gt;I haven't suggested an FWB relationship to her though, and i don't know if i should (yet).

Dude she's already brought up sex with you; why the fuck are you not being clear with her about what you want? 

If you want to invite her out for ""date 2"", just invite her our. This time, make it clear with your actions and words what you actually want. If you don't, she'll leave you for one of those other guys you are worried about who is honest with her and himself about his desires. ",0

5nb2od,RightwingLGBT,"I've found a home here I felt ostracized after revealing my decision that i'd be voting for Trump, this past June on Facebook.

Almost all my gay friends immediately started leaving nasty comments, some even unfriended me, and honestly what surprised me the most though was how intolerant they were being of my decision.  When I was on the other side, I didn't agree with my right wing friends on alot of issues but I never insulted them and still considered them my friends.

Since that day though, my eyes have opened a whole lot more to how non accepting the left really is and after casting my vote for Trump, I haven't regretted my decision since and it actually has surprised me how most republicans have treated me with respect and support, /r/the_donald included.

ihsykkz,nametheproblem,"yes. horrific story. he murdered her mom/his wife, as well. typical case of male family annihilator aka perpetrator of modern femicide.

edit he was abusing them for years, as well. 

from judith’s wiki: (trigger warning for abuse, descriptions of murder, male violence, etc) 

As Barsi's career success increased, her father József, an alcoholic, became increasingly angry and would routinely threaten to kill himself, his wife and daughter. His drinking led to three arrests for drunk driving.[1] In December 1986, Maria reported his threats and physical violence toward her to the police. After the police found no physical signs of abuse, she decided not to press charges against him.[1]

After the incident with the police, József reportedly stopped drinking, but continued to threaten Maria and Judith. His various threats included cutting their throats as well as burning down the house. He also reportedly hid a telegram informing Maria that a relative in Hungary had died, in an attempt to prevent her from leaving the United States with Judith.[5] The physical violence continued, with Barsi telling a friend that her father threw pots and pans at her, resulting in a nosebleed.[6] As a result of her abuse, Barsi began gaining weight[5] and developed compulsive behaviors, such as plucking out her eyelashes, and pulling out her cat's whiskers (see trichotillomania).[1] In May 1988, after breaking down in front of her agent, Ruth Hansen, Barsi was taken by Maria to a child psychologist, who identified severe physical and emotional abuse and reported her findings to child protective services.[1]

The investigation was dropped after Maria assured the case worker that she intended to begin divorce proceedings against József and that she and Judith were going to move into a Panorama City apartment she had recently rented as a daytime haven from him.[7] Maria's friends urged her to follow through with the plan, but she hesitated due to her fear of losing the family home and belongings.[8]

On July 28, 1988, the Los Angeles Times reported that three people were found dead in an apparent murder–suicide and that the bodies were believed to be those of Barsi, her mother Maria, and her father József.[9] The article quoted Police Lt. Warren Knowles as saying a flammable liquid, likely gasoline, had been poured on the bodies of Maria and Judith by József. József's body was found in the garage, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Neighbor Eunice Daly stated she heard a gunshot around 8:30 a.m. on July 27, prompting her to call the police.[10] Barsi and her mother were buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in adjoining plots.",Oh that is so heartbreaking.

ljz25l,askAGP,"What to do now? Hi fellas,

Thank to this community, I got a name for my condition.
Guess I've been into girly clothes since i was i kid. Now it's more involved..

Got 3 yrs relationship with my gf. Sexual attraction seems gone now.

I thought I could brainwash myself out of this. Doesn't really work... And im not sure if theres any scientific solution. Didn't find any.

Did I lose everything (as my heterosexual, ""normal"" life dream)?

Who betrayed me? My hormones? My neurons? My DNA?

Whats now? Give up and start a lonely life till Im dead?

Any strategy, suggestion, anything really, will be appreciated

Thank you","Sorry for your loss man, I can only empathise with you.

Some members will argue that you can live a normal heterosexual life as an AGP.

It's also possible that you didn't really discover everything about yourself and might encounter a deeper sexual arousal in the upcoming months, at the end you are the only one to experience those emotions, it's purely personal.

**Who betrayed me? My hormones? My neurons? My DNA?**

Most likely some genetics, hormones in the womb, and your environment. At least that's what influences one's sexuality. 

**Any strategy, suggestion, anything really, will be appreciated**

Any therapist will tell you that you are ""normal"" because you were born like this and you are not harming anyone. Therefore the healthiest way would be to accept those feelings as they are and do not repress them. The first stage will be acknowledge them as they are, then accept them as valid feelings. It's up to you if you want to repress this side of your sexuality. 

The side effects of repression can push you into depression, create insecurities, and encourage mental/behavioural dissonance when it comes to your thoughts. 

That's about it.",0

e3rxtoj,AganistGayMarriage,"I actually agree with some of your points about how some marriages don't require love but gay couples have multiple ways to rear children these days
","If you mean that gay couples are capable of conceiving children, then I must confess I haven't quite kept up with the science on how that is possible.  If, however, you merely mean that gay couples are able to adopt, then I would be hesitant to accept that this amounts to an argument for gay marriage. Again, I think it comes down to what you think marriage is for; whether it's simply for raising a child, or whether it's for raising YOUR child.

Again, there are two views here; there is the view that marriage and procreation are inherently linked together, and the view that marriage need not necessarily be about procreation, but could be purely an expression of love.  I view marriage as an institution governing procreation and its social aftereffects, and as such I would not be comfortable extending it to couples incapable of conceiving children.  If, however, you take up a more romantic view and argue that marriage need not be about conceiving or raising children, then of course you would see gay marriage as a natural right for all men and women.

I think that the debate about gay marriage fundamentally comes down to what you think marriage is for.  If you take the conservative (and probably unpopular) view that marriage is a social institution governing over procreation and the raising of children, then the idea that marriage should be extended to any two people who love each other would be fundamentally missing the point of marriage.  If, however, you take the romantic view that marriage is simply an expression of love and dedication to one another, then denying marriage to someone based on their sexuality would be inhumane, senseless, and probably homophobic.

The issue with gay marriage, for me at least, is not really about freedom of religion vs  freedom of love.  It has always been about two competing interpretations of marriage; whether you take the conservative and dull view of marriage as a social structure for organising human society, or whether you take the more exciting and romantic view that it is an expression of love and dedication which any individual is free to express.

I'd probably think that it's the former rather than the latter, but I know better than to expect people to agree with that view.  That view is dead and gone; and if it isn't gone, it is dying out, and has been dying out for the past 200 years.  The whole argument about gay marriage specifically - which in reality affects only a small minority of people (I'm not trying to be mean, but it is my understanding that homosexual couples are still minorities) is just a red herring for the wider shift in social views about the institution of marriage as a whole.",0

50bt7b,MensRights,"Do you find it acceptable that, according to some, certain phrases can only be used by one gender, but not the other? I got into a – drunk, I must admit – discussion with my girlfriend and would like to know your opinion. 

Before I start, two things:

1. Please don't judge my gf solely based on this piece of information. I'm honestly new to this sub and don't know the general atmosphere here, but I don't want her judged based on a sole and minor discussion we had.
2. I keep in mind that this sub might be biased and I accept a predictable answer, but am interested in hearing your opinion anyway. 

So here it goes.

--- 

We were talking about a (female) friend of mine and at a certain point I described her as ""a woman with balls"". 

She responds that she doesn't actually like the phrase. It's one of many little things that glorifies characteristics that are ascribed to men, while so-called female characteristics are often still perceived as negative. She suggested using a gender-neutral phrase. I agreed with her and stopped using the phrase. 

Recently, on a drunken night, she used the phrase and I called her out on it. She said that women can say it because it has a different connotation. Now, when I'm drunk, I tend to choose to discuss – often the most inane – topics with a passion, regardless if I'm knowledgable about them or not. And so I did with this statement and I started disagreeing (loudly) with her. She actually had to stop me not more than a few minutes into it, because she didn't want to have a fight about the use of a simple phrase. Neither of us agreed with the other. Or probably even got a decently underpinned argument, considering the alcohol involved. In other words, the night ended in disagreement. 

What's your opinion on this subject?

**TL;DR:** do you agree that only women should be allowed to use the phrase ""she's got balls"", or any similar ones? If not, can anyone or should no-one use them?",Language control is stupid. There should be no bad words. The concept of bad words is divisive and leads to control issues. It's stupid that we fight over words.,0

l7zh23,askAGP,"AGP is like a drug. But why? Also, it’s all about sex I’ve struggled with AGP for most of my life so far. I’m currently 27yo and I’ve been crossdressing since I was 11. I’ve been trying to stop since I can remember. I’ve made promises, I got caught by my mother, I’ve spent a lot of money on clothes and makeup just to throw it all away on a purge and then buy more. The longest I’ve been able to stop was 5 months.

In august last year, I started dating a girl and I decided that I’d finally stop. Things were going good between us and I had no urges at all to do anything agp-related. But then our relationship started to get more complicated, in a bad way, and the urges came back.

So, the day before yesterday I finally did it again. I put on my sister’s clothes, did my makeup and went out for a coffee. The thrill I got was indescribable. I guess it must be like what a cocaine addict feels right after a snort. And then it hit me: AGP is like a drug. My agp is behavioral and transvestic. That means I get turned on by wearing girl’s clothes and behaving (stereotypically) like a girl.

I usually like to put on some fancy lingerie and watch a girly tv show. After getting back home, that was what I did yesterday. I put on “Emily in Paris” and Netflix and laid on my bed watching it on my girliest attire. I was high on dopamine. I wanted to be her. I wanted to look like that, to wear her dresses, walk on her high heels, be a girly girl. I was really aroused, but I knew that if I masturbated the fun would be over. “Post-nut clarity” would make me regret everything I did.

So I decided to put on a chastity cage. That was something I initially avoided, because of its close relationship with sissy porn. Watching porn while dressed up is something that came in late for me, and when it did, it was just regular porn. But I guess that sissy porn is like porn on steroids for people with AGP. I also have a bondage fetish, so the cage fits in well with that. In any case, this time I decided that I wouldn’t watch any porn at all, and that’s what I did, regardless of the cage. The only thing I allowed myself to do was to read some blog posts of a guy’s “chastity journal”.

After a while, I couldn’t help it any longer. I had to masturbate. I removed the cage and masturbated “like a girl” (that is, I tucked my penis between my legs and gently rubbed the tip of it with two fingers, like a girl with her clit, instead of stroking it). I got one of the best orgasms ever. But then, of course, the fun was over. I removed the makeup, put away the clothes and thought “that’s it, never again”. Well, I may have thought I was over with it, but it certainly wasn’t over with me. That same night, there I was again, wearing a chastity cage under my lingerie and watching Emily in Paris.

I tried to sleep like that. It was something I did rather easily when I was younger, in my first years of crossdressing. I would put on some panties under my pajamas and just go to sleep. It felt good. But lately it’s been hard to do that. I get anxious about it and the anxiety keeps me awake. Anyways, after a terrible night’s sleep, I got up, took a shower and dressed up. I went to the mall, bought something from the bookstore, had lunch and came home. I was high again. I tried to stall, avoid the masturbation so the thrill would last longer, but I couldn’t. I masturbated and it was over. And then it hit me: it’s all about sex.

When I was seeing my girl, I was sexually fulfilled. I didn’t have to do that. The thought didn’t even cross my mind, and when it did, it was quickly dismissed. But then things got cold between us and I was sexually frustrated again. That’s where the urge to crossdress came from. At first, I didn’t realize it. I thought to myself: this is going to be a non-sexual dress up. I’m not even gonna watch porn. I’m dressing up just for the fun of it. But that’s the thing: the fun of it is in the sex. Strictly from my experience, there’s nothing “non-sexual” about it. AGP is all about sex. The moment I put on a pair of panties, I get aroused. That’s why sooner or later I have to masturbate. If I was made to live like a girl for a week, doing my regular business (go to work and get home), I would get bored. I wouldn’t see the fun in it. I’m not trans, I’m just a guy with a fetish, I guess.

So why am I writing this? Tbh, I don’t know. I just wanted to share this experience with you lot and see what you think of it? Does anybody feel the same? Can some of you relate to it? Please, tell me in the comments. Sorry for the long post and thanks a lot if you read it all.

UPDATE: i wan't planning on doing it today, but then i got bored and guess what: chastity, dress up and Emily in Paris it is. May even go out for a drink later","This is relateable to me. I thought I found my 'True Self' when I met &amp; started dating another AGP trans person.

That relationship ended &amp; so did the persona I built around it. The persona wasn't fake-- it was as real as anything --but it wasn't true to me. Holding on, prolonging suffering by extending attachment. That was where it got worse &amp; I realized my AGP tendency has a life of its own as a thoughtform entity.

I'm doing my best now to treat that entity with care &amp; love while I integrate it into my wholeness. Ultimately, my AGP entity is a fatally-rewired part of my psyche that's meant to help me relate to others, but it's been redirected to 'help me' relate to/love myself for/as who I am. I need to understand its purpose while also providing my body/mind/spirit a healthy adaptive outlet to express self-love. 

Otherwise, it's like we're exploiting our own spirit by moulding what should be a relational complex, into an inward-facing mask.",0

aihp2w,asktrp,"Time to use Dread? I've been seeing this girl (23) for 5 months. After 2-3 months I conformed from Alpha to Beta, failing from that new relationship energy. She's not my girlfriend but we are exclusive. Sex has been great but seemed to peak after I showed my emotions. 

She has brought up ""not being ready for a relationship"" twice one reason being she recently broke up with her Ex of 3 years. When she said this I just brushed it off. However, about a month ago I opened up and asked why she's not ready and basically came off as needy and that she's my only option.

 Next two weeks, thing just didn't go right. Things have picked up a lot but the sexually attraction has dropped a little bit and not where i want it to be. 

I started reading the red pill and slowly gave her less attention (Not saying good morning, not calling that much, answering her late bc I am busy). She started calling me, immediate texts back, and finally started texting me dirty shit. THen she told me she is ""ready"" to be in a relationship. This morning also said her dad wants to meet me. 

But she seems more comfortable denying me sex. Last night I fucked her twice for 2 hours and made her cum, this morning, however, i started making a move, she said she didnt want to have sex, (either bc she was tired or didnt want to be tired for her work party later) Iusually stop but we were in a hotel (we live with our parents) so i started eating her out. She was enjoying it then shaked me off so i got up and took a long shower and didnt give her attention. She started feeding me and filing my nails as i layed on the bed. THen she asked ""Are you annoyed we didnt have sex?"" (she does this every-time she denies me) I simply say no and act natural.

I am getting tired of her saying no to sex, even though its not too often, but often enough now where it bothers me.

49yf7t,fPUA,"How much is *too* much initiating? I've had three dates with this guy over the course of three months due to Christmas, me being busy, etc. Flouting gender roles, I've asked him out each time and each time he's seemed keen, we've gone out and had a good time. On the third date we had (pretty damn hot) sex.

We've also texted **a lot** (our text history is a saga at this point). We've been texting less recently, though it's still pretty consistent e.g. 1/2 texts a day which are quite long. 

Now, here's the issue. We had a fourth date set up a couple of weeks ago (that he initiated) but he cancelled at the last minute (family tragedy). He was extremely apologetic, said that he had been  looking forward to meeting up &amp; that he would reschedule. The weekend after he was busy (also with family tragedy) but this weekend I fully expected him to arrange something but...nothing. We've been texting and he mentioned us doing the activity we were planning on before he cancelled but hasn't actually organising anything.

It's now been a month seen I last saw him and I'm getting a little sick of just texting back and forth. I know we're both free this Saturday - would it be way too forward for me to initiate **again**? Should I just leave it up to him? 

I'm worried that he's just not that fussed or has got used to me initiating all the time, which I'm not that keen on either.

7inpo2,ForeverAlone,"I’m done. Socializing is the equivalent of saving a thousand tickets at Chuck E’ Cheeses through patience, some skill, and mostly luck.  Cashing that in only gets you fucking silly bands.

I’m not here for a woe me, I want to add my 2 cents (at the bottom) and vent. That being said I’ve always been the outsider. The only time I wasn’t was when I was very young and in pre-school daycare. That lasted through kindergarten and ended when I started 1st grade. 

I was a strange kid which would have isolated me completely if a teacher didn’t intervene and “introduce” friends to me. It was clear that the friendship was built on the fact that a teacher said so, else there would be consequences. Expanding the social circle was met with rejection, as no one wanted to be associated with the weird kid. 

You’d think my social awkwardness would mellow out in my new group of friends, but it was only met with counterfeit smiles and fake laughs. It’s part of the reason I absolutely hate adults forcing friendships amongst children. To be fair I would encourage the same, I wouldn’t want a child to experience isolation like me, and it’s crucial to their development! Forcing with fear of punishment could work, but you risk a backlash that creates a false sense of community which is the isolation I’ve struggled with.  I’d say people should guide friendships in children, not force them.

Otherwise you got a kid doing their best and wondering why they’re in the wrong. 

After my mother passed away, and I had to move to another state with grandparents. The first day at my new school the teacher told the class that my mother passed recently and that they should be nice to me.

Being “The Kid Who’s Mom Died”, so be nice to him created a false sense of community. I was friends with people, but was never spoken to unless there was group assignment. I had only one best friend, and he helped me get through a lot. I don’t remember how we met, but it might have to do with an argument at recess that somehow bloomed into a friendship. 
To briefly reminisce, we got Pokémon cards banned because our trades. Then we got it unbanned by convincing a teacher that Pokémon battles encouraged math. We weren’t allowed to trade though, only battles, so we had fake battles to trade. We put counters on the cards and everything to be convincing. 

It’s the shame that he had to move, the title “The Kid Who’s Mom Died” and it’s curses followed me into middle school, same kids from elementary just older and more viscous, myself included. Being diagnosed with a disability and to eventually have to use a motor chair made it worse.  

I did get another bestie in the early years, he introduced me to The Legend of Zelda and got me into video games in general. Eventually he moved too. Middle school wasn’t all bad, it just got worse as high school approached. The verbal abuse in my “friends “ group got worse and so did my abuse at home. They only kept me around because of my title, disability, and that I made them laugh. 

Of course being a middle schooler I tried to talk to girls, everyone else had a relationship, so I felt left out. 

To sum that up in one painful memory, a teacher forced a girl to dance with me at a school prom. She clearly didn’t enjoy it, neither did I. This happened twice. Two different school events. Both of which included the teacher having a group of girls taking a group photo with me.

That wasn’t the worst memory though. Come the day before graduation they had the graduating grade assemble for a slideshow of all the pictures taken from when they first came into middle school.

The girls were the most verbose and cheered whenever they saw their friends on the screen. The girls were also more involved in extracurricular activities, so they had more pictures. I myself only had a few taken of me, mostly ones that teachers took “highlighting” the social aspect of my middle school career. 

Now all the girls practically knew each other, there was still cliques of course, but you heard a cheer from their side at just about every picture with a girl in it. 
I say their side because being middle school, all the boys sat with each other, and all the girls did the same. So it was very distinct who was cheering. 
There was also quite a few boys who were also active in school events, some even dated each other, so the slide show was mostly popular kids and couples.

With each slide their was a cheer. Either some popular girl playing sports. Some popular guy doing volunteer work.

The crowd went silent when pictures included me.

Then roared right back up again.

At first I thought it was just a coincidence, but it kept happening. The nail in the coffin was when the crowd started to cheer and quickly hushed when I was noticed. It wasn’t like a class photo, It was a photo of this one girl and I, but since she was within the rule of thirds and i wasn’t, she was noticed first, then me second which caused the hush.

I was trying so God damn hard not to break into tears, it didn’t help that I saw the concerned look and cringe of the teachers. 

Thankfully high school was much bigger and had students from other towns. So I avoided anyone from my town like the plague.

The relationships I did manage was mostly facade. I’ll be their shoulder to cry on, and their comedian, but me? Nah screw me. I’m disposable. One person in particular was like this and it was also just pure guilt tripping, verbal and emotional abuse. I’m finally in the process of cutting them out of my life.

Talking to girls was just met with ghosting and dumb signals. 

First girl I had a crush on in high school was cold, distance and bitter to me. To her defense I was still very socially awkward, and I believed a lot of Nice Guy bull shit back then. Eventually I moved on and started talking to other girls and she didn’t like that at all. So I tried to reconnect with her. Same thing till one day I bumped into her seat with my wheelchair, and let out a OMG SO SORRY. Whole class heard, whole class didn’t care, but me and her. She was so embarrassed and pissed I got ghosted. She even went as far to avoid me by taking different routes to class, even if it meant being late.

Another girl I spoke with was giving me one worded responses, so I gave up. Later I find out she was pissed that I stopped talking to her. 

Another, one girl I flirted with, we both knew she had a boy friend, but I was a horny teen who never got that kind of attention before and she clearly liked it. Just dropped me like a ball, never heard from her since.  To be fair it was never going to work out, just sucks we couldn’t be friends.

After the drama I decided to give up dating on high school, wait until after maybe. Decided to make one exception because she seemed super chill and mature. 

Talk to this  girl, make her laugh, she asks me to walk her to class, gives me her number. I then text her time to time. Then I say that I’m heading to the movies with friends and she welcomed to come. She declined and that’s fine, we keep talking and joking, ask her again. I say I’m going to movies alone but she’s more  than welcomed to come. Also fine, both  times she said she was busy that weekend and we seem to mesh well. So I ask her in person, “hey I really enjoy your company and would like to know you better, when are you free?” She says she’ll let me know.

Ghosted.

3 months later she acts like we’re still buddies, so I shut her out. Never spoke again. I’m not going to spend weeks talking to you and trying to get know you only to be ghosted. I’ll be damned if it happens again. 

Had it at that point, but come senior year I made another exception.

We talked one time. It was an amazing half an hour conversation and we respected and challenged each other’s views. It only ended because it was time to head to class.

I see her in the hall, say hi. Ignored. I figured she didn’t hear or was too focused, but after numerous attempts I finally got a response.

It was a scoff.

I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me, and at this point I don’t give a shit.  How do I self improve if know one tells me what I did wrong? I learned a lot of how not to act through a trail of fire. Despite this it feels like everyone has the a social script and I’m just tossed onto  the stage with nothing.

I wonder how different things would be without my disability. I’m not ugly, some days I’d say I’m handsome. So I feel like my disability pushes a lot of people away. I wouldn’t want to spend time with people that resent my condition, but at the same it feels like it’s always in the way socially speaking. 

Any ways, after that the isolation at school and the abuse at home got to me. Ended up in suicide watch because my sister convinced me to.

College is refreshing because I’m not forced to interact and i can be invisible because no one cares. 

Now I’m just trying cut my family out. Most of them are strangers to me. The few I do know ignore the abuse and blame me. I have my sister, but I don’t love her or even like her. I can tolerate her. She’s supportive but it doesn’t do me much good. All I feel is guilt and shame in the relationship and when I address it she just says I did nothing wrong and that what I said and did in the past means nothing to her now.

Fucking lie.

It’s very clear that her behavior has changed around me due to the past. It wasn’t anything like assault just arguments. Because of the horrible things I said she acts differently and we are growing more distant by the day. We only have the past in common and I don’t feel like starting anew with her, because she says really ignorant shit but acts like she’s intelligent. Sad thing is, she is but she strokes her ego too much she ended up like Neil Tyson. She should stick to what she knows and not what she thinks she knows. 

I just feel so isolated around her, around anyone. 

I asked her not to visit come Xmas but she cried and I felt bad, so I changed my mind on the fly. I don’t how I should do it, but it I’m going to tell her to leave me alone from now on. It’s on Xmas no less, but I frankly don’t give a fuck. It sends a message. Another reason why I’m cutting ties is because she doesn’t respect my wishes well.  After my diagnosis of depression , any attempt by me to establish new boundaries in the relationship was just met with “Oh you’re just depressed.” 

Sick of it.

I feel like the protagonist from There Will Be Blood. 

All that build up to the famous milkshake scene, and what follows after.

The movie ends with one line. I’ll always remember the way he says it. 

“ I’m done.”

I tried Tinder, had a few matches with women, but mostly men. It’s the same skit but worse.

I tried in person to talk to women and men, I know I talked about my experiences with women, I didn’t really branch out to sane sex till recently.

All this isolation by “friends”, my community, my family. All I want is a connection.

My therapist is worthless, only seeing her because the facility says it’s mandatory in order to see the psychiatrist. 

Meds are worthless.

I have to emotionally distance myself on kissing scenes in movies, and just porn in general.

It hurts knowing that I even if I try I won’t get it.

Even if I do, it’s not worth it.

It’s so much effort wasted just to feel a loving touch and connection from a man or woman. 

The only connection I’m going to strive for is with myself.

That’s it, I’m done.


My 2 cents:

There’s such a thing a social entitlement. Where people can make friends and partners with ease and do not understand the reality that people can be and sometimes choose to be forever alone. Some people are and will be against their will. People who say it gets better and to be patient are delusional and socially entitled.

I know it’s normie advice but focus on yourself. That’s it, just you. No relationship is going to happen wether you do or don’t. Might as well make the most of it with what you have. Maybe a relationship does come out of it, good for you, but don’t get your hopes up. It a matter of luck and it may never happen.

I’m 19 years old and already giving up. People have had it worse than me for sure, but we aren’t here to play “Who Had It Worse?” 

Just focus on you as if you were to be forever alone. Chances are you might be. If within your hobbies you meet a cute guy or gal good luck, but remember that. It’s mostly luck you two ran into each other. 

Even then, after a relationship forms, despite all your time, your efforts and all your silly bands.

All you have in the end is you.

fpwex67,BlackPillScience,"It's fairly significant.

My testimony is only anecdotal, but when I learned about the RedPill and was utterly obliterated mentally by it, I *insisted* upon testing the theories out for myself.

In the RP, the term for ""mate copying"" is *preselection*. It was something I was very interested in, mostly because a great deal of human behavior related to decision-making is based upon preselection. Even the illusion of preselection is enough to influence a choice, which is why *advertising* works.

Story time.

I was a regular at a bar some time ago, and the bartender was this amazingly sexy 25 year old (8.5/10 at least.) The clientele was typically 90% male, and no doubt she fended off several advances on the routine. I had a first-date that night, but I arrived early to chat with the other regulars (that's Social Proof,) and wait until my date arrived. I shot some shit with the bartender, didn't get any indicators of interest from her (as usual) before getting a lame ""side-hug"" and going off to read and enjoy my pint.

My date showed up, bought a beer and I waved her over. We bantered for a bit, made out a little, and I decided she was too inebriated and didn't want to have sex with her that night, so I suggested we call it a night while I queued up another date with a younger and more attractive woman.

We left, I picked my second date up and then went back to the same bar. Every regular there was surprised, but remained silent, and it turned out that my second date not only *knew* the bartender, but had attended college with her as well. She mentioned how great I was and excused herself to the restroom. Once out of sight, the bartender saw me with all new eyes and started genuinely interacting with me. Later, she started initiating physical contact with me in front of my date and even sat in my lap. I got her number and we had a fun fling for a couple of weeks.

Once that evidence opened my eyes, I started creating the *appearance* of preselection, by doing things like having an open condom wrapper in my car's cup holder, buying a set of women's lingerie and leaving the panties hanging off of my dresser and the top crumpled in a corner. I also advertised my preselected status by actively referring to other women I was seeing as ""one of my girlfriends."" It made dating infinitely easier.

It doesn't even have to be real. It just needs to be *plausible.*",Wow,0

&gt;In all honesty, I couldn't give a rat's ass about White Nationalists; there's a very small handful of individuals left that believe the USA should be a country for white people only. Mostly everyone thinks they're a bunch of morons. I think President Trump would agree, not in those words exactly but he's stated as such.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't ever want to see any opinions become illegal.. but that out of the way.. why does this post seem to be sympathizing with White Nationalism? If a movement/ideology is violent/dangerous/terrorist (KKK, Antifa, NeoNazi, etc.).. members of that group who have committed crimes should be tried for the crimes they committed or helped others to commit.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't give a shit about your skin color, your sex/gender (whatever you believe it to be), or your religion (as long as it isn't a death cult) either. I agree that these things should never be illegal.. but why does he mention White Nationalism at all? I want nothing to do with that filth. This just seems to be a BS tactic to make it look like Trump supporters are exactly what the left has been saying of us.

d8d8eti,GCdebatesQT,"Trans people don't like participating here because it's not really a place for them. It's become another echo chamber for GC, primarily. I see redditors like Me_Melissa trying hard and it makes me sad because they're wasting their time. 

No one wants to try to discuss things in a place where they will be attacked from 10 different directions and be treated with incredibly thinly- veiled hostility and hate (which if they dared to return with a similar tone, they'd be banned for.)
Regular users here have admitted they will never change their minds no matter what and are only here to ""blow off steam"" aka talk shit to trans people. Why bother?","If it has become an echo chamber (which I disagree on), it's only become one because of a lack of trans participation. 

I do think Melissa gets frustrated here from time to time, but I'm always thankful for their participation, even when I disagree. Except when they call my posts bad -_- but I got an apology last night so alls good :D 

Finally, is it attacking or debating? I like a good back and forth and think that's the purpose of holding a debate. At what point does a debate turn into an attack? 

Also, I said earlier that a debate isn't meant to change minds, but to *exchange* opinions. I don't expect trans people to give up their perspectives, I just want to hear theirs and let mine be heard. The point of bothering is to reach an understanding. ",0
efjyyce,HateCrimeHoaxes,"&gt;Adrenaline/stress/shock in my opinion would lead a victim to immediately remove the noose out of self preservation. Having something wrapped around your neck is a very primal threatening thing. The idea to leave it on in order to preserve evidence is something a calm, rational person would do.

You raise a very good point. So does that mean he was extremely calm throughout the whole ordeal and if he was, what other reported behaviors support that? Or does it mean he put the rope on himself with the intention of leaving it on for emphasis? 

&gt;The idea of not going to a bar or club because it would be right before closing and ""not worth the time"" goes completely out the window if your motive is to try to have sex with someone...

My main frame of thought behind the sex scenario had to do with hookup apps such as Grindr or Tindr. My apologies, I did fail to mention the use of hookup apps in my original post. Its unlikely, but not impossible, that he went to a club before closing with the intention of hooking up but its plausible he hopped onto a hookup app to arrange a quick encounter. 

&gt;People regularly ask police to turn off their body cams when making a report or giving a statement? Is that true? It seems incongruous, surely they understand their report is to be reported?

I mentioned this because I have seen it mentioned on the tv show ""Live PD"" as well as heard it on some investigation discovery shows. Unfortunately, I can not source or confirm that statistic so you're right I can't say if thats true. I will edit the original post to reflect that.

fijjoi,TGandSissyRecovery,"I need help I’m 17 years old and i realized i have AGP 6 months ago, although I’ve been having urges to transition for 2 years. I have access to HRT so obviously when i felt i wanted to transition i started self medicating. I don’t have psychiatrists that can help because i live in a very conservative and religious country that doesn’t accept lgbtq folk. If i tell them I’m trans/ AGP they’ll call me a pervert and I’ll be put in prison for “debauchery”. Anyways, I’ve noticed a pattern, that whenever i take HRT (which lowers my testosterone therefore lowering my sex drive) my desires to become a woman go away, i start worrying about the minor breast growth that i got. I worry about how my family and friends will react if I transition. I feel like I’m wasting my childhood because of a stupid fetish. I get motivated to start working out and getting a girlfriend and all that shit. I start thinking logically. So when i stop taking my meds, i start working out i get motivated to try r/nofap, all of these activites boost my testosterone, which makes me super horny all the  time, so my desire to transition comes back. But also the muscular body I developed makes my “dysphoria” 10x worse. This loop has been pretty much going for 2-3 years. At this point when i had no way to treat this thing, i thought, if taking HRT makes me sensible and function with a normal guy’s brain but at the cost of having a girl’s body, will this be the only way of getting rid of it? So I’m currently 1 month into HRT with the goal of becoming a guy and not a girl, and let me tell you this, it still doesn’t work. I’m currently on the line between becoming a trans pornstar and hanging out with my friends this summer and enjoy the few years i have before being thrown into adulthood. I’ve heard about people getting rid of AGP with nofap, but I don’t know if this is possible or not (my maximum number of days was 8). Should i try nofap while I’m on HRT? Should I transition? I need help!","Loaded post. I mean if you want to transition, more power to you, but you won't be supported where you are, and it's a hallmark of your identify if you do transition. Can you possibly leave? I know it's not that simple. But frankly it doesn't sound like a great place to stay regardless. You sound like you literally cannon control yourself when you are horny, is that true? I don't know you, but if you can be this clear-minded now, then you should try and be this clear minded all the time, and then make the right decision as to transitioning.

Recently, I've had a few girls specifically either ask my age or mention there's, which I've wondered has been specifically trying to judge if it's feasible and thus also a 'IOI' possibly.

(In one case, she was mid 20s and immediately lost interest in talking to me, though I had no interest in her myself.)","I'm not quite there but I'm in my 30s. 

Personally, there's a bit of calibration here. Like most shit tests, very often it doesn't matter what the answer is, so long as you're good at playing it cool regardless of what the question was. If she's joking, then joke back. ""Don't worry I won't tell anyone you're robbing the cradle."" ""I swear I'm legal just let me get my fake ID out.""

If she's seeing if you flinch at the fact that she's half your age, if you're interested, don't flinch. Just own it. Lean on your life experience and challenge hers. Find things that you'll have a chance to introduce her to. 

On the other hand if she's serious, then play it straight. If she's really turned off by it then it's better to know now than to know in a few weeks or months. Don't outright lie. That doesn't mean you ever have to actually say your age, but if it's clear that it's a deal breaker, then just tell her best of luck and move on.",0

Just set some money aside specifically for impulsive stuff so that when you feel the urge you can indulge without ruining your budget.

I have struggled with an eating disorder for 9 years and body dysmorphic disorder for at least 11. I've only recently started to read about gender issues (for lack of a better all-encompassing term), and I've noticed that the descriptions trans people give of how gender dysphoria feels sound almost exactly the same as how BDD feels to me, aside from the parts of the body each focuses on. That has led me to wonder: how is gender dysphoria different from BDD, and why do we take literally opposite approaches when addressing them? This doesn't make sense to me, and I would love to hear the opinions of everyone here. ","There is a subtle but important distinction between the two. With Dysmorphic disorders, there is an inability to see what it actually going on.

Another problem is that people who have skill in one realm of life may not have skill in another.  For example, [Lebron James earns $71 million a year](https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffeim/1-lebron-james/#7f6d602447b2) but if I need carpentry done he is not the guy to call.

The Chinese government is trying to do a similar thing with their [social credit system](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4) which is kind of funny for a socialist / communist  state that claims equality for all.

** Herbert Spencer**'s views of social darwinism have been mostly rejected by academics.  **This makes the claim that the High IQ people support it suspect.**

A good read is

In its modern revival, the words of social darwinism seems to be mostly relegated to groups with the mentality of white highschool boys.

the above journal article shows the english academic contribution, but outside of academia, the group most keen on social darwinism are the white supremacists like Aryan Brotherhood (who should be first to go in a cull)","A more realistic reason is that the less able people are now consuming too much of our precious resources.

Lebron is just an entertainer. Historically entertainers were into another caste - they were paid a lot but never given enough power to matter. If they grow uppity, just look at Tiger Woods. While people like Floyd Mayweather are annoying, they don't have real power and they are kind of outliers and not really matter too much as far as real power is concerned.

The Chinese social credit system is not new. A Taoist named Yuan Liaofan proposed it in 1603. And, because China had too many people in a smaller resource base the competition was very, very fierce; and because of polygamy poorer people did not get to reproduce. So, it did have its gene improvement over the years. naturally, the hinterlands which never had the chance to be integrated into the central system didn't have social darwinsim while the major cities, Peking and Nanking (Canton only became important later; Shanghai was just a suburb of Nanking and are the same cultural zone, and Hangchow, not far away, is also in the same cultural mold) , the social darwinistic pressure was very heavy because prices were not cheap and poorer people didn't really have much chance.

decfbao,ActualWomen,"Hey there. I also struggle with nightmares from PTSD. It definitely makes mornings (and going to bed) really hard. The only thing I've had that's been really effective is marijuana. I don't use it terribly often but if I'm going through some hard stuff with PTSD, I will use it before bed to make sure that I have a dreamless sleep. However, depending on your situation, this may not be an avenue you want to explore. I was able to get a medical card because of my PTSD and it really helps when things get rough.


Aside from cannabis, I'd suggest trying some form of relaxation before bed. Guided meditation, muscle relaxation, focused breathing, whatever suits your fancy. Any sort of stress is only going to increase your chance of nightmares so try to just focus on letting your body relax. I would also avoid any sort of violent media. Getting those ideas planted in my mind makes it more likely that they'll resurface in your dreams. I spent years watching only silly comedies because of nightmares.

Try to take care of yourself. Not knowing what your brain will cook up at night is really scary. What goes on during your day does have an impact on what you dream of at night. If at all possible, give yourself a bit of a break and reduce stress in any ways you can.

Know that you're not alone in this. I don't have any answers for you but I do know that you will get through this. The nightmares will eventually stop. Even though these nightmares are terrifying, they can't hurt you. Be strong. DM me if you want to chat.","God I wisg medical marijuana was available to PTSD patients here.

Thanks to /r/seduction,I've had more success in the past 6 months than I have in my entire life. I'm more confident than ever, I can get dates and escalate with ease, and thanks to that, I've had more success in the past 6 months than I've had my entire life.


~~~~

However, this is a very peculiar situation with a girl who, *I think*, was trying to friendzone me.

From the first moment I met her, I knew I'd get oneitis because we just clicked (lame, I know). We've been on a few dates and they've all gone fairly well up until tonight, which was VERY odd.

The dates I've been on have all gone well, she's very receptive, we kiss a lot, and I escalate whenever I can. I can tell something's off though. *We still haven't had sex yet*. 

I think some damage was done when I told her, *on the 3rd date*, that my goal right now was to be in a relationship with someone. Not her specifically, but just a committed relationship. My reasoning was, hey I'm being honest with her right? What's the worst that could happen. Well her response you could probably predict, she said, ""I'm not looking for that, but I still want to see you"". I chalk it up as a loss, but not something detrimental.

One night I ask her out to a movie, she'd rather I just come to her dorm in a ""we're probably not gunna fuck"" way. I assume the worst, but I agree to come her place tonight anyway. 

I try to escalate more and again... nothing. The night's winding down, and I call her out, I ask why she doesn't want sex (more eloquently of course). She gives me a bunch of bullshit answers like, ""I usually only fuck guys at parties and stuff"", then, ""Last time I had sex was **3 days ago**"" That one stung, even though we were far from exclusive. She then half-jokingly says, ""I've got you in the friendzone haha"". I keep cool, but fucking lose it on the inside. I tell her straight up that I feel disrespected that she'd lead me on, even after I'd been so honest with her. Sounds like a typical AFC story right? But what she does next really confused me.

She apologizes a lot for leading me on, and says she recently got out of a long term relationship. She said she really wanted sex after the second date, but it we were too far away from either of our homes. I essentially tell her that I really enjoyed her company, but if she's going to act like this, I'm saying bye. She refuses to let me go and asks if we can ""start over"" with a  tears in her eyes. I say I'll think about it and that I'd text her if I was interested.

I'm thinking I've got 3 options.

1. Break off all contact and never text her again
2. Text her, saying that I don't think we'd work out
3. Agree to the date and try and start over

Anyone get into similar positions? Any suggestions would be helpful.


Edit: Thanks for all the input guys! I'm really grateful.

If anyone's interested,  I ended up just texting with option 2. It surprised me how ashamed she was of the way she was acting, given she'd always complain about how bad she was treated in prior relationships. Anyway she even offered to set me up with a friend because she felt ""guilty"". I declined of course, I've got other prospects.

fk5lbmi,RedPillWives,"I’m going to give you some tough love that might upset you, but I hope you can hear me out and look at what I’m saying:

Firstly, your insecurities and bitterness are coming through incredibly strong in the post. You talk about her being younger (which shouldn’t be relevant, unless you are insecure about it). What you’re describing about her “bragging” seems to just be normal dinner conversation UNLESS her attitude was rude. She didn’t bring up what exactly she does until somebody asked. She didn’t even brag about the amazing benefits first — she talked about the stresses.

It sounds to me like you’re unhappy with the lack of appreciation you’re getting in your own life (being a homemaker) and are comparing yourself to this woman, and judging her for it. I say this because you seem sour when you say “I am busting my ass in a more skillful full-time job” — who’s to say that your job or hers is more skillful? Why do you feel the need to compare skills like this? You seem possibly upset that your husband was impressed by her career...but if we just look at it objectively, what she's doing IS impressive. He wasn't fawning all over her talents, I'm sure. He just had a normal reaction considering the circumstance. 

I imagine that if you felt appreciated for the work you do, you wouldn’t be speaking like this. That makes me feel that you should have an honest and calm conversation with your husband and let him know that it would mean the world to you if he could acknowledge what you do in whatever way is most helpful to you (verbally, physical affection, etc). It seems like this is one of the roots of the problem, rather than her attitude.

I’ll also go out on a limb here and say that it shouldn’t really matter if she wore a revealing bathing suit — why is that an issue for you? My guess again, is insecurity. I don’t think what your husband said is inappropriate (that he is happy for his friend).

Lastly, I believe that you brought up her unhappiness in her relationship because you see her as “better” than you (you feel plain around her, your husband said she’s cute, she has a better job financially) and you’re looking for something to bring her down in your mind. The fact that she’s not happy makes YOU happy, because you don’t want her to be happy.

To wrap it all up —

&amp;#x200B;

1. I think you should work on your insecurities — unless she’s done something clearly rude that we don’t know about…it sounds like she’s just a normal woman with a different life circumstance, and you’re letting that bother you. Figure out the root of why this is.
2. You should talk to your husband and communicate what your emotional needs are revolving around taking care of your child and house. If you need more appreciation, there is no shame in saying so :)
3. I urge you to not compare yourself to other women and find ways to put them, or yourself down. (Again, this is assuming she hasn’t done anything that’s outright unkind). In life, this is such an easy way to be upset about things that don’t really matter. It will rub off on other aspects of your life. When you could be having a lovely time with your husband, your mind might be obsessing over whether or not him calling her “cute” is crossing the line or not.

I know that may have been a lot of constructive criticism…but you are clearly a dedicated woman: being in this sub and having the patience to take care of hour household isn’t something to gloss over lightly. That shows how seriously you take your life :) because of that, I think you’d be even happier if you just approached all of this with level-headedness, confidence in your worth, and communication w your husband. Insecurity can completely take over your life so it's best to nip it in the butt and address it within yourself, no matter how hard that may be.

Who knows though, maybe a little extra love and affection or verbal compliments from your husband are all you need to feel on top of the world and not feel bad during situations like these :)

Good luck!","Great reply! I think you're right in almost all points.

Dementia is no joke; in some ways it's worse than death because the person you love is there, but not really.


There is no dealing with loss without emotions unless you are a psychopath. TRP doesn't say otherwise. What it does say is to understand what you can control and what you cannot. In this case, all the crazy shit that is going on in your life is out of your control. Accept that this situation is entirely about other people; you are just along for the unhappy ride.

Listen. **You are not dealing with a normal situation.** There is nothing wrong with feeling all sorts of fucked up about what is going on in your life, because *it is* fucked up. Your grandmother is quite literally losing her mind, and your mother is not helping. I'm not saying that religion is bad, but your mother's beliefs are crossing a line where they stop being helpful.

You are the son/grandson, not the parent. Don't take the burden of ""fixing"" things on yourself.

ecif7ox,GenderCriticalGuys,"But sadly labels do matter in this world, like when someone tells someone that they’re a lesbian or that they’re gay and aren’t attracted to their genitals it trans people should stop instead of calling it transphobic. If anyone argues with you about how you’re straight for being attracted to transwomen show them this study: https://www.them.us/story/cis-trans-dating

It shows that everyone’s sexual preferences align with the sex assigned at birth for their partner rather than “gender identity”. Also lol it’s apparently a shock to the people who wrote this article (and probably would be to GenderCynical if I wasn’t banned for giving real statistics on their lies) that lesbians would be okay with dating transmen and not transwomen and that gay men are okay with transwomen and not transmen. Like surprise, people have genital preferences. It’s not bigoted to sleep with people who’s genitals and secondary sex characteristics you’re attracted to.

It’s hilarious to see people in the GenderCynical thread randomly bring up biphobia and not realize that they’re literally engaging in bi erasure.","Well it is truly ridiculous when they write that ""for some people, sexual orientation might be not (just) about a partner’s gender identity"". WTF, seriously. It's not like our ancestors would have evolved to be attracted to other cave-people who feel like the opposite gender, when the most important thing was making babies.

But I'm not sure if sexual orientation can be self-identified any more than sex can. And how is attraction defined? 96.7 percent of straight men said they aren't attracted to trans women, but that doesn't mean they've never been attracted to a trans woman they saw on the street or online or whatever. Of course they still aren't bigots if they don't want sex with someone with a penis or neovagina.

d4yytna,RedPillWomen,"I'm a longtime lurker and I think this is a great post but I have one question...

&gt;Alpha Red Flags:
Regularly flirts with other women in front of you.

Isn't this just 'dread'? I see it get recommended a lot on MRP which honestly, doesn't make sense to me - I don't see the point of dread if you're in a LTR with someone. So, I guess this is appropriately labeled as a red flag. (And I know this sub isn't really affiliated with MRP, I'm just confused as to why it's recommended constantly over there.)

And

&gt;Makes it clear that he doesn't care about your feelings.

Wouldn't this be considered 'amused mastery'? I've seen some of the women here actually praise it, which I'm also confused about. I don't get how amused mastery or dread would improve a LTR at all.

I guess this is a irrelevant comment since they're already labeled red flags, but I'm curious as to why some praise them.","As far as dread and amused mastery are concerned you're correct: they serve a purpose for men and are very handy in situations. However, I would have a **serious** problem with my husband dreading me even though MRP advocates men doing this to their women so they don't get unmotivated in their relationship. That's the point. It specifically benefits the male. While some women may benefit in specific instances from dread, it's an exception not the rule. 

Amused mastery is the same thing. If a woman is shit testing or being unreasonable, AM is a perfect way to deflect. My husband does this to me (he doesn't know that's what it is but he does do it) but it's in specific instances where he is willing to bet that I'm being unreasonable. I usually am. However if he sees something is truly bothering me, it never progresses to him outright mocking me. 

That's where the mix of beta/alpha traits comes into play as an ideal man for a woman to date. Yes, when the waitress hits on my husband it's a good reminder and ego boost to me that DH is still very desirable to other women. It motivates me to keep my game on par so I don't have to compete with other women. Amused mastery is good because 9 times out of 10 I'll realize I'm being ridiculous and laugh, but taking these things to an extreme is not conducive to a desirable partner for a LTR. Hope that helps!

epne7e3,The_Europe,"So this is the problem with the simplistic view that the Bible is just an instruction manual for Christianity. It's a collection of disparate books that make up a salvation narrative. Part of that narrative includes a time when the people needed simple rules to live by because they lacked the moral foundation to live up more fully to God's designs. Thus Jesus is challenged by the Jewish scholars on the topic of divorce, which is permitted in certain circumstances in the Old Testament. He replies to them that it was allowed only because of their hardness of hearts, and calls his followers to understand that no couple joined by God can rightfully be separated by man.

Looking at the Bible in such a simplistic way leads only to confusion and error, particularly of the type above where people imagine that Christians are bound to observe Mosiac restrictions, despite the argument and resolution of that very issue being recorded in the book of Acts. (TLDR: they aren't.)

I don't know if the Koran is similar, and somewhat suspect not given the short time over which it was written, but I don't know it well enough to say for sure.","The Koran *is* similar. And many Muslims will use exactly the same justification for its texts as you have just done.

what you call revenge fantasy in an attempt to silence the truth is the reality of our society, people like you who censor the reality that shooters and incels and the entire generation of men who were taught that they are nothing more then violent white incels and should kill themselves for no reason, now a lot of them do, thats why men suicide rates are way higher then females, the ones that have pride dont kill themselves and take the clown pill and shoot up the school.

we are taught to believe that they are bad people while people like you and the people that the chad meme impersonates are the ones who created them.","Bruh, if you actually did your research you would realise that the number of females who attempt suicide are actually identical to that of men , except that men- in the world we live in- are much better at committing suicide due to them more typically owning firearms- which is an extremely effective way of killing oneself. Hence why more men successfully commit suicide then women. 

There is nothing good about shooting up schools, and anyone who thinks that is a sick fuck- especially considering they often prey on the weak, this is in part because of their twisted ideologies - but also because of the catalysing effect of their mental health issues like severe autism and so on, which whilst tragic, is no excuse for their actions.

d4tj8qm,TheRedPill,"1. Female drama has completely taken over reason in the show. The last 2 episodes are a shit dump without any sense of logic. If you don't not see the stupidity and just get off from the cheap soap-opera melodrama, where the good guys win and the bad guys get what they deserve, you might be a twat. Double check to be sure. Well developed plots, strategies, politics and power struggles, are all replaced with fast revenge solutions, straightforward thinking and deus-ex machina. Exactly the opposite of what the show was about and what made it great.

2. There are no real men on the show. All have been killed off, and the ones left standing are either weak, castrated, lacking limbs, killed and returned from the dead, a dwarf, a crippled etc. All are cucked somehow. Jon is Sansa's bitch (fights her battle, almost left to die on the battlefield, makes nothing of her betrayal), the dwarf is Dany's bitch, Jaime is Cercei's bitch, Theon is Yara's bitch, Tommen is Margaery's bitch (or was) etc. All men had to be fucked somehow and lowered under females, to make women look more powerful, because there is no other way for a women to look powerful next to a powerful man.

3. You have an all powerful Queen with no real skill, intelligence, understanding of politics and reality. She tames dragons, rules over a huge army of rapists and savages, and an army of eunuchs. She single-handedly killed all alpha leaders of the most powerful warriors in one blow, and took over their army. She has by her side a dwarf, a castrated politician, a castrated warrior, an alpha Chad warrior that turned into a little bitch almost crying at her knees (ultimate female fantasy) and another alpha warrior that risks his life to hell and back for her. She supposedly fights for peace and freedom for everybody in the world. Promises lesbian Yara a throne just because she's a woman. Makes her promise not to rape and pillage anymore, but disregards that most of her army is made from rapers and pillagers (but of course, she'll tame them eventually). 

4. You have a scrawny little girl princess that popped out of nowhere and is smarter than all the men ruling the great houses of the north. Puts them all in their place with a few words and makes them apologize for being stupid.

5. You have another scrawny little girl with a death list on a killing rampage in the name of justice and revenge. She can not be stopped and it is clear she will survive everyone in the show just because.

6. You have a swordsman female that bested one of the best fighters in the realm, the Hound. 

7. You have a cunt princess that was forced into marriage, raped and abused, but got oh so strong and overcame her rape. She got complete revenge over her abuser. Girl Powa'!

8. You have the old woman (Tyrell) that is smarter than all around her and controls her House. Now she goes after revenge. 

9. You have a fallen queen that makes all irrational mistakes possible for 6 seasons but ends up on the Iron Throne after she got her revenge.

10. You have a bunch of lesbian tomboys taking over a kingdom because they wanted revenge and the king didn't.

11. Whatever the writers did differently from the books, it reeks of PC feminism BS, cheap drama and complete lack of logic. Fuck it. No more.",Well... then... go White Walkers!  ,2

f4qrqoi,TheRedPill,"Interesting stats.

&gt;50% of men are uncomfortable seeing two men kiss

Notice how right away there are trying to equate masculinity with homophobia when in reality they have nothing to do with each other.

&gt; 19% of men identify as feminists.

That's actually lower than I thought, I hope that number doesn't go up but with all the indoctrination going around I am worried it will.  I wish they would ask men how many consider themselves Red Pilled but they probably don't want men to even hear the phrase lest it lead them here or to MGTOW.

&gt; 37% of men say they are uncomfortable crying at weddings

Why are they asking about weddings?  I have never cried at a wedding not because I would have felt uncomfortable but because it isn't the sort of thing to make me cry.  Such a stupid question and obviously meant to mislead the reader.  If they were serious they should have just replaced the word ""weddings"" with ""funerals"".

&gt; Percentage of men who worry about their mental health on a daily basis:

&gt; Ages 16 to 34: 38%
Ages 35 to 64: 20%

The age difference can easily be explained by our gynocentric society telling boys that there is something wrong with them for acting like boys and treating them like they are defective girls, among other things.

&gt; 10% of men have taken a yoga class

This also has nothing to do with masculinity.  Yoga is good for your health and all the best yoga instructors are men who are in phenomenal shape.

&gt; 38% of men have used a moisturizer in the past six months.

I'd really like to see a racial breakdown of this one because I'm guessing that 38% includes a lot of black dudes.

&gt; 72% have raised their voice to settle an argument.

Oh FFS, who doesn't raise their voice in a heated argument?  This is presented as if it's evidence of ""toxic masculinity"" and implies that women don't also do this.

&gt; 54% have seen their fathers cry.

I have seen my dad cry exactly once, when our beloved family dog died.

&gt; 45% of men say they want to be somewhat or very similar to their fathers

I'm guessing the other 56% are mostly either the children of single mothers or divorced women who get custody and both are raised to be what Rollo calls ""promise keepers"".

That is much as I will get into it, but it is pretty clear that GQ is cucked.","It's not really surprising they are asking such meaningless questions. GQ is a magazine for men (arguably) from a **feminine point of perspective.**

Crying at weddings, taking yoga classes, be passive in arguments, it's all things woman do and take interest in. Even the father thing, they wanna see them cry to feel emotionally connected with them but that's not the way a boy and his dad create an emotional bond. For example, I have a deep respect and love for my old man for his strong character and for doing activities with me, not for any seeing vulnerability or any of this shit.

So I think we shouldn't take their words seriously and take it as an example on how masculine if framed today by the media.",1

2ux62d,fPUA,"Did I not play my cards right? Throwaway because not everyone should know about my love life. Tl;dr at the bottom

Okay so this is between me [17F] and a guy [17M]. We’re both high school seniors but go to different schools. We live in Europe by the way

Met in october 2013. We kept texting after that for a while. At this point we’re just acquantances. He kind of showed interest but at that point I wasn’t really ready for something so we never ended up hanging out. Fast forward to a few months later. We start texting again. We become better and better friends. He starts adding x’es to his texts. I like it. Contact kind of slows down a bit during finals and summer (busy lives). Since october we really start texting again and this time it’s going somewhere. We text like every day, are snapchat best friends and he’s sorta straightforward that he finds me attractive (that sounded awkward as hell how I said it but its actually not). Whenever we try to set a date to hang out, something either comes in the way last minute from either of us or we just have to delay it like 2 weeks because there is almost never a moment where we both are free. Despite so many last minute cancelled dates he stays persistent in having to hang out.

I was skeptical about his interest for me, because I’ve known him for over a year and I’m sure he didnt have a girlfriend between now and then. Seems fishy, because he’s veeery good looking and smart and just very popular in general. He’s basically got girls queuing up for him. So either he’s looking for something serious or he’s a gigantic player that doesnt need a girlfriend to get around. Knowing the average 17 year old guy, I’m inclined to believe the latter. So I tell a (guy) friend about him, he knows people that know him and screens him for me. Turns out the latter isn't true. Looks like I’ve really scored someone eh?

Turns out we were both going to the same party last friday. He told me beforehand he would have to leave at 2 am though because he had a game the next day. So I spot him at the party, we dance together. I’m a bit tipsy but it doesnt bother him at all. He holds my hands, gives me some tight ass bear hug and says (hard to translate to English but more meant in a romantic and not so awkward way) “you’re honestly super nice/friendly/pleasant” and when he’s about to leave he kisses my cheek. The same guy friend from a few moments ago ofcourse looked at the whole thing lol and says that when a guy does this kind of stuff, he’s either interested or gay as heck.

Now that we’re close to a relationship or whatever you would call it it seems that things have stopped. The weekend after that, my phone broke for 2 days. As soon as the thing works again I text him that I really liked friday and sort of apologize for being a bit too drunk for a while. This was sunday night. He finally responds tuesday night saying he liked it too and he doesnt mind that I had too much. The rest of the conversation was kind of slow and a bit forced.

We havent said a word since tuesday. Shit. I reaaaaally dont want him to fluke out but it’s kind of unusual to not show a sign that he's alive at all for this long. Especially since the last time I spoke to he was touchy and all that. Maybe he’s shy? He can be a pretty shy guy sometimes but I’m pretty sure he’s aware that I’m interested in him too. Or am I just exaggerating and being overly attached here? Probably idk. People said to give him time to text until the end of this week but my gut feeling tells me he’s not going to do that. What possibly could have happened?

**Tl;dr: Cute guy shows interest. We run into each other at party. Shows he's interested. Close to no contact ever since. Is he just really busy with his life or did I do something wrong?**","This might blow your mind, but sometimes there aren't reasons for things like this. It also sounds like he might have been nervous and that's why he would cancel... I've been there. In the end, its not really possible to know why its like how it is, but I don't think you did anything wrong.  

If you guys really wanted it to happen, it would happen. Can't really force these things. ",0

When I tried to make the point that bi-sexual literally meant two-sexual (not many-gender), and that dating was inherently discriminatory (most people aren't open to dating anyone), I was duly mocked for being transphobic.

As a black bisexual, I’m well aware of the importance of combating bigotry and racial and gender stereotypes, but I don’t believe that we need to break the English language, or attack the innate sexual orientation of others (isn't this sexual harassment?) to achieve this. It's a simple fact of life that not everyone is going to be into you. Some people will be; others won't. How has this become a controversial point? And what's the endgame here? To eventually make being a non-pansexual an act of hate?","

&gt;""I’d never met Mr. Epstein before. I had contacted him because my colleagues and I had heard a rumor that he was advising Tesla’s embattled chief executive, Elon Musk, who was in trouble after announcing on Twitter that he had lined up the funding to take Tesla private.......  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Epstein avoided specifics about his work for Tesla. He told me that he had good reason to be cryptic: Once it became public that he was advising the company, he’d have to stop doing so, because he was “radioactive.” He predicted that everyone at Tesla would deny talking to him or being his friend......  
&gt;  
&gt;I kept trying to steer the conversation back to Tesla, but Mr. Epstein remained evasive. He said he’d spoken to the Saudis about possibly investing in Tesla, but he wouldn’t provide any specifics or names.""

From 2011\~2012, Jeffrey Epstein was in regular contact with Elon's brother Kimbal Musk.

[https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-epsteins-ex-girlfriend-dated-kimbal-musk-brother-of-tesla-founder-elon-musk-2020-1](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-epsteins-ex-girlfriend-dated-kimbal-musk-brother-of-tesla-founder-elon-musk-2020-1)

In 2015, Elon Musk introduced Epstein to Mark Zuckerberg.

[https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/07/jeffrey-epstein-case-grows-more-grotesque](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/07/jeffrey-epstein-case-grows-more-grotesque)

Musk tweeted that his 2014 photo with Ghislaine Maxwell was the result of her having ""photobombed"" her, this turned out not to be true.

[https://futurism.com/the-byte/epstein-associate-elon-musk-if-scrub-internet](https://futurism.com/the-byte/epstein-associate-elon-musk-if-scrub-internet)

Musk once sued Top Gear and Jeremy Clarkson because they made ""Tesla look bad""

If these Epstein reports were not true, he would have sued any one of them.

Zuckerberg spokesman: “Mark did not communicate with Epstein again following the dinner,” meaning Mark did communicated with Epstein at least once. But apparently, Musk says he never met the guy.

Musk says ""Doesn't that seem odd?"" in **mid-2022** after people all just kind of let it go.

It's to convince people that he had nothing to do with Epstein. It's like that time Musk tweeted he isn't receiving subsidies.

So even after his death, Epstein was useful to Musk.",0

e0o5zdb,GCdebatesQT,"Well, talking about sex as a social construct isn't new; Thomas Laqueur in [Making Sex](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674543553) shows that the interpretation of physical features has varied a lot through history, and the strict separation between male and female is a relatively recent invention, which had the retroactive effect of shifting from description to a norm and lead to corrective surgery of intersex people to make them match with what was supposed to be ""natural"" (see JS Mill's *On Nature* to understand why this line of reasoning makes zero sense). So yeah sex is a social construct, but that doesn't mean it isn't an interpretation of real things and that it can be changed at will in a short time frame; it has the characteristics of a social phenomena. As for the ""penises are female"" *used seriously* I haven't seen that besides a few people on the internet who also had a lot of other issues and caused constant drama. Some may also use it as a rhetoric to provoke people. I wouldn't be surprised if some others actually confused gender and sex and had no idea they are engaging in a radical constructivist metaphysics. Most trans people are no bullshit though, but hey, I guess the few ones who go too far or are clueless about words are too funny to mock to pass on and build a transphobic narrative based on that.

Edit: oh, you were talking about allies too. Well, try to talk to them, I'd bet they're just parroting trolls and not realizing it, or are ridiculously clueless about sex/gender etc. The Internet has allowed any idiot who writes somewhat convincingly to set up a blog and gather a following.","&gt;the strict separation between male and female is a relatively recent invention

My (ex)girlfriend and I have been having a lot of problems that we have been trying to work through. We have both confided in our best friends. My best friend's advice is to do what I want. Her advice was for her to leave me.
I don't know the girl all that well and her opinion on me has been based on hearing the bad my girlfriend has told her. She doesn't even want to get to know me. The last interaction we had together she completely spun everything I did and made it seem like I attacked her(verbally of course).  She felt so strongly about it that she told her to choose between me or her. Of course it sends my ex into a frenzy trying to decide. I went ahead and made the choice to leave. 

It was one of the hardest decisions I have made but I thought it was for the best. My heart is hurting because I feel like I've lost the love of my life because I jumped the gun too fast.

2. DO NOT do the same hard exercise 2 days in a row. These are squats, bench press, deadlift, barbell rows, overhead press (the exercises of the Stronglifts program). Follow this rule religiously if doing Stronglifts 5x5 or a similar hard lifting program. 

3. Pay attention. Always pay attention to what you're doing or you'll be getting a one way ticket to snap city.","3. is probably the most important the reason is that you don't have a coach to pay attention for you. and even those who have a coach get injured because of this. 

1. is relevant primarily around stalling, if you stall there is a reason for it oftentimes related to some joint not being handled correctly 

and I'd like to add 4: do your homework, there are warmup routines on you tube , you need to understand mobility a bit if you don't have ankle flexibility there is no way around it 10 squat sets per week won't fix it alone if its an issue. it won't injure your ankle but your knee/back/hip will compensate for it in some weird way.

dgoynwt,Gender_Critical,"Unfortunately Katie Couric's Gender Revolution National Geographic documentary reinforces  very common gender myths and gender stereotypes,that has never been proven,that gender identity is caused by in utero hormones,that ''hard wire our brains to be female or male.


 It has an interview with parents of two little boys and the younger one ''became'' a girl,and the mother says that her youngest son told her that she knew she was a girl in her heart and brain,and of course loves to wear lots of dresses.



I have read posts on forums similar to this,by heterosexual women,many who are married who said they hated dresses as children and some still do as adults,and they said they were ''tom boys'' as little girls.


Not to mention before world war two people used to dress little boys in pink because it was seen as a strong ''masculine'' light red color,and put girls in blue because it was seen as delicate and ''feminine''.

Important information from October 2015 by neuroscientist Dr.Lise Elliott about how new large research shows the sexes brains are much more alike than different! Three major areas in the brain that were claimed to be different were found to not be different using over 6,000 women and men including the myth that the corpus callosum is more connected in women.

 
 http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-10/rfuo-mbd102915.php





Here is a new January 2017 extensive brain study by neuroscientist Dr.Lise Elliot and her colleagues did of 30 years worth of brain scans of women and men and girls and boys in the area of the brain called the amygdala which past studies based on much smaller samples claimed to have significant differences between the sexes. The findings show that despite the impression  that men and women are profoundly different large analyses of brain measures are finding far more similarity than difference,there is no categorically ''male'' brain or ''female'' brain and much more overlap than difference for nearly all brain measures.The article says this area of the brain is a key structure involving all types of  emotion and social behaviors such as aggression and sexual arousal.



 Dr.Lise Eliot said,It mentions implications for understanding transgenderism in this new article too.

Here is my important blog with a lot of strong great research studies and information,Debunking Common Sexist Myths Of Gender,



https://alotofresearchstudiesotherimportantinformationdebunkingcommonse.wordpress.com/2017/02/18/test-bank-the-marriage-and-family-experience-12th-edition-strong/




","I have an excellent book from 1979 written by 2 parent child development psychologists Dr. Wendy Schemp Matthews and award winning psychologist from Columbia University, Dr.Jeane Brooks-Gunn, called He &amp; She How Children Develop Their Sex Role Identity. 

 
 
They thoroughly demonstrate with tons of great studies and experiments by parent child psychologists that girl and boy babies are actually born more alike than different with very few differences but they are still perceived and treated systematically very different from the moment of birth on by parents and other adult care givers. They go up to the teen years.
 
 


 
They also show that surveys show that boys are overwhelmingly preferred over girls,(sadly nothing has changed and sexist woman-hating,girl-hating Tee shirts that say( I'm Too Pretty For Homework So I Let My Brother Do It For Me) (and other sexist anti-female ads,pornography,etc do too) like these both reflect and contribute to this injustice.They also explain that when people guess if a pregnant woman is having a girl or a boy,and they list a whole bunch of false unproven sexist, gender myth,gender stereotyped,old wives tales,that assign all negative characteristics to a woman if they think she's having a girl,and the imagined girls or given all of the negative characteristics.
 
 

 
For example they say that author Elana Belotti(1977) explained these examples, The man and woman each take hold of one end of a wishbone and pull it apart.If the longest part comes away in the man's hand,the baby will be a boy. If you suddenly ask a pregnant woman what she has in her hand and she looks at her right hand first ,she will have a boy;if she looks at her left hand it will be a girl.If the mother's belly is bigger on the right-hand side a boy will be born,and also if her right breast is bigger than her left,or if her right foot is more restless.
 


 
If a woman is placid during pregnancy she will have a boy,but if she is bad-tempered or cries a lot,she will have a girl.If her complexion is rosy she's going to have a son;if she is pale a daughter. If her looks improve,she's expecting a boy;if they worsen,a girl.If the fetal heartbeat is fast,it is a boy;if it is slow it is a girl.If the fetus has started to move by the fortieth day it will be a boy and the birth will be easy,but if it doesn't move until the ninetieth day it will be a girl.( Belotti 1977,pp.22-23)
 


 
Dr.Brooks-Gunn and Wendy Schempp Matthews then say, now rate each of the characteristics above as positive or negative. A woman expecting a girl is pale,her looks deteriorate,she is cross and ill-tempered,and she gets the short end of the wishbone,all negative characteristics. They then say,furthermore ,a girl is symbolized by the left-the left hand,the left side of the belly,the left foot,the left breast. They say,left connotes evil,a bad omen,or sinister,again the girls have all of the negative characteristics.
 


 
They then say,that sex-role stereotypes about activity also characterize Belotti's recipes:boys are believed to be active from the very beginning and girls have slower heartbeats and begin to move around later.They then say,the message although contradictory(girls cause more trouble even though they are more passive) is clear in that it reflects the sex-role stereotype that boys ""do"" while girls ""are"" and the belief that boys are more desirable than girls.
 
 
 


They also say that parents have gender stereotyped reasons for wanting a girl or a boy,obviously if they didn't it wouldn't matter if it's a girl or boy.When my first cousin was pregnant with her first of two girls people even strangers said such false ridiculous things to her,that they were sure she was going to have a boy because she was carrying low or how stomach looked.
 


 
I once spoke with Dr.Brooks-Gunn in 1994 and I asked her how she could explain all of these great studies that show that girl and boy babies are actually born more alike with few differences but are still perceived and treated so differently anyway, and she said that's due to socialization and she said there is no question, that socialization plays a very big part.
 
 


 
I know that many scientists know that the brain is plastic and can be shaped and changed by different life experiences and different environments too and Eastern College gender and Christian psychology professor Dr.Mary Stewart Van Leewuen told this to me too when I spoke to her 15 years ago. Dr.Van Leeuwen also said that human beings don't have sex fixed in the brain and she told me that humans have a unique highly developed cerebral cortex that allows us to make choices in our behaviors and we can learn things that animals can't.
 
 
 


There was another case in Canada that I read about online some years ago about another case in which a normal genetic male baby's penis was destroyed when he was an infant and in this case he was raised as a girl from the much younger age of only 7 months old,not as late as 21 months as was David Reimer,and research shows that the core gender identity is learned by as early as 18 months old.
 
 

 
 
In this other case,it was reported in 1998 he was still living as a woman in his 20's but a bisexual woman. With David Reimer they raised him as a girl too late after he learned most of his gender identity as a boy from the moment he was born and put into blue clothes, treated totally differently, given gender stereotyped toys, perceived and treated totally differently than girls are in every way(in the great book,He and She:How Children Develop Their Sex Role Identity it explains that a lot of research studies and tests by parent child psychologists found that they give 3 month old babies gender stereotyped toys long before they are able to develop these kinds of preferences or ask for these toys. They also found that when adults interacted with the same exact baby they didn't know was a girl or boy who was dressed in gender neutral clothes,they decided if they *believed* it was a girl or boy.
 
 
 

And those adults who thought the baby was a boy,always handed the baby a toy foot ball ,but never a doll and they never gave an infant they perceived to be a girl a toy football, were asked what made them think it was a girl or boy and they said they used characteristics of the baby to make the judgement . Those who thought the baby was a boy described characteristics such as strength,those who thought the baby was a girl described the baby as having softness and fragility,and as the Dr.Jeanne Brooks-Gunn and Wendy Schempp Mathews explain,Again remember that the same infant was being characterized as strong or soft,the actual distinction by sex characteristics being only in the minds of the adults.
 
 
 


They also explain that in the toy preference studies,girl toddlers often show an initial interest in the trucks,but eventually abandon them for a more familiar type of toy. Also check out Kate Bornstein's books,Gender Outlaw and My Gender Workbook,and recently a co-written book,Gender Outlaws. Kate used to be a heterosexual married man who fathered a daughter and then had a sex change and became a lesbian woman who now doesn't identity as a man or a woman. I heard Kate interview in 1998 on a local NPR show and she totally debunks gender myths,and rejects the ""feminine"" and ""masculine"" categories as the mostly socially constructed categories that they really are.She even said,what does it mean to feel or think like a woman(or man) she said what does that really mean.

I understand that, especially since the 2015 Charleston shooting, there are good reasons why parishioners might exercise caution. In fact, when I brought up the idea with a liberal white friend who has Southern roots, she seemed legitimately horrified that I'd even considered doing such a thing. Was she overreacting, or do I sound like a would-be voyeur? Is there a good way to sit in on a black church service?

j79fcu6,aznidentity,"&gt; as a petty aside, why was this white guy nitpicking his underlings' ""walking pace"" lol

If you read the article, you'd discover he works in food services. His ""underlings"", as you called them, are people who make and deliver food. They're not programmers or corporate shills.

Your aside wasn't petty as much as it was misinformed.","Two other people brought that up. I skimmed over that part of the article in part because the ads on nypost make it borderline unreadable, so that was my bad. I left it up since others corrected me in the replies and it wasn't that serious lol.

If anything, it means his job consists of complaining about low wage earners not moving a bit faster, while having a desk job. I'm not sure if this is better than picking on high salary workers, as I had mistakenly said. I haven't been inside google's cafeteria. whether he's coming up with reasons to complain about the ones doing all the hard work or he has a valid point isn't something I would know. I do know I don't see a whole lot of POC with that gig compared to the ones frying their hair in kitchens. 

However, since I have worked in retail and food service myself (this is why i said underlings, I was being tongue in cheek), I am aware there is mutual resentment with the workers who do all the manual labor and face customers, and management who complain but don't necessarily help directly. There are definitely workers who move slowly, but again, it could be due to physical handicaps or any number of reasons. Stuff like preventing allergens/cross contamination/food safety or safety in general (not moving so fast you bump into someone and get injured, signalling if you are holding something hot, how you carry heavy packages) ranks higher on the list of concerns.

Management would likely say they have to oversee a lot and are stressed and that it is just as hard even if they're not on their feet damaging their backs. If something serious happens like a hospitalization from allergens or workplace accident, they are the ones who shoulder blame even though it wasn't their doing.

 Most management are head hunted rather than working up from the bottom, so someone who sees both sides objectively is kind of rare. 

 Either way, I doubt he's reading this or that he cares what anonymous people have to say.",0

e5xjqnb,DebateAltRight,"IQ is not a scientific metric. It measures how well single individuals do on written exams concerning word problems. Also, there is no standard between different tests or testing agencies to ensure any reliability between tests. It's bunk. Geniuses of every color have scored well below 100 on IQ tests. Intelligence itself is not something you can quantify with a written paper test. For example: Louis Armstrong was a musical genius who failed out of school at a young age. But you could never be as talented as him at creative improvisation with singing or the trumpet. Kim Peek was a white man who could read two book pages at once and had a near-perfect memory but couldn't understand personal hygiene. How would your pathetic IQ tests gauge their intelligence? See, your pathetic intellect has to over-simplify an infinitely complex concept like intelligence into purely a race issue.
Race is also not a scientific metric as it over-simplifes the concept of ethnicity to their skin color. Black people are the most genetically diverse people on the planet. The range of intelligence between individuals within ethnic groups is FAR GREATER than between ethnic groups. Are you keeping up? Making generalizations about us just shows your ignorance about biology. 
I think it's rather hilarious that you use two UNSCIENTIFIC, NON-REAL concepts to try to prove your intellectual superiority over black people. I bet you believe your horoscope, too lol.","&gt;IQ is not a scientific metric.

If she liked you and the date she would’ve been delighted at that text message and you wouldn’t have been ghosted. So it sucks but at least you didn’t sit there and waste your time. Being mean to girls to get them to like you is the stupidest shit I’ve ever heard","A parent probably doesn’t enjoy punishing their children but there is an extremely important usefulness from the unpleasant interaction a good parent will take on. 

Honestly, at a certain level of intellect I assume this is the case of every relationship, romantic or not. 

Once you start interacting with someone else you stop becoming a me and start becoming a we. 
It’s a cooperation between two completely different stories. 

I can’t say I know the answers, that would be foolish, but at some point you start wondering if acting a certain way (even though it doesn’t feel good) doesn’t actually translate better for making the girl feel safer and happier in some fucked up way. 
Wouldn’t it be nice to be genuine and completely honest but at some level you realize you’re smarter than them and you’ll have to create a feeling for them of safety and security, or you meet a girl smarter than you and she understands your honesty.

f85p65y,RedPillWomen,"I have recently decided to become a homemaker too and it was incredibly tough decision for me. 

I have felt very strong desire and purpose to become a housewife but I struggled with the fact that it is such a rare “occupation” especially for young girls (I’m 21). 

My whole life I have deemed myself to be very intelligent and ambitious person who wanted to prove everyone how high I can get. I associated ambition, wits, interesting personality and passions only with a career. After I started working in a corporation and understood how all of this works and how does a typical schedule look like I decided that it is not what seems right for me and it is not something my heart longs for.  Everyday I daydreamed about staying at home and cooking, cleaning, having time to finally take care of my looks and my interests. I wanted to have energy to greet my husband after he comes home and be available for him. 

It was hard to get rid of the stereotype that women who stay at home are lazy and unproductive. That they have no personality. It hurt my ego a lot and I didn’t want to admit I could be one of these people. But now I know I am not and I won’t be and that those are just stereotypes that I shouldn’t care about. 

My only worry was that something might happen to my husband. But then I thought... what is the actual probability of that happening? Surely - tragic events take place in the world but how often do men in developed, safe countries suddenly die at age of 35? We shouldn’t organize our lives around unlikely events! Everyday when we leave home we face risk of dying in some horrible accident or a crime. Every time we enter a car or a plane we take a risk of dying in a car crash. If everyone were to worry what will happen to them or their relatives no one would ever leave the house! Not to mention you can easily die at home as well. But we all know these things are not so common. 

And even if my husband were to die very soon... I am happy I will stay at home to spend more time with him and cherish him and serve him, instead of wasting my time in front of monitor, counting when can I return home. 

You need to put faith in your man. It makes them do incredible things. You worrying about him loosing job is sending him a clear message that you don’t believe in him and his competence and it really hurts men ego. Try thanking him and saying how grateful you are to be able to stay home. Tell him how lucky you feel to have a man that is so hardworking and provides for you - like a REAL man. I will guarantee you... he will work even harder and be more motivated for you and your future kids!","I just wanted to say thank you for writing this! Like OP, I’ve also struggled to let go of a lot of the ideology that was instilled by my family and friends growing up that’s made me feel guilt and shame for enjoying what I want to enjoy out of life. 

It’s definitely a struggle but it’s good to know that I’m not the only woman out there who had to go through that mental and emotional process of letting it all go and embracing feminine nature and letting your lifestyle fall into place. Giving myself permission to not force myself into a lifestyle I don’t want in the name of some sort of societal solidarity was the hardest thing, especially because when I first started I still tried to make myself fit into the expectations of feminist culture.",0

cajeug,Amberlynn,"The Most Hypocritical Reaction Channel? Hi guys so lately I have been watching a youtuber that goes by the name Shaquana Jefferson and she does videos talking about Amberlynn. After enjoying her rants about our gorl for awhile now I can't help but think she is a little bit (a lot a bit) of a hypocrite. Here are some ways:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Talks about wanting to lose weight but she's gained 30 el bees since January

\-Refuses to weigh in though continuously talks about her weight

\-Claims her scale is broke

\-Keeps saying she is going to quit smoking but continues to smoke and make excuses

\-Her animals are not very well behaved

\-Gets bent out of shape of 'haydurrs' 

\-Claims to be the original ALR response channel, all the others are copycats or just here for money

\-Over shares about her life but calls out ALR for doing the same

&amp;#x200B;

Aaand there's probably many more as well...

&amp;#x200B;

anyways I was just wondering if any of you guys watch the Original Queen of Response videos... She's really quite a handful. I do enjoy watching her videos but now I view them as more of a trainwreck instead of just ALR commentary.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts? Are any other reactors hypocrites in your eyes?",Can’t stand her. I think she’s absolute trash. She’s got a shitty attitude and doesn’t bring any real valid points to her discussion. The smoking in the apartment thing reallllly bothers me. And how can you judge someone for actively doing the exact same thing? (Rapid weight gain)not a fan of her at all.,0

232m6v,fPUA,"Kino vs. Touchy Tendencies? Hi fPUA!

So today this guy that I've kind of had an ever-so-slight connection with in one of my classes was my partner today during a lab. As we're working together he brushes up against me a lot and practically grabs my whole hand while I'm handing him something. I'm just wondering if this was kino or if maybe he's just the sort of person who doesn't really consider personal bubbles. (I don't watch him often, but I'm kind of thinking he's not the most touchy-feely of people in the universe, but you just never know.)

So basically, my question is how you can tell the difference between someone using kino and someone who just does that to anybody and everybody?

eggtszv,smuggies,"So what you’re saying is that a man (the woman) deserves to be hit by a car (sexually harassed or assaulted) for running onto a highway (going into a “grimy” place or dressing a certain way). 

Let’s take your analogy further. Did the man make an effort to avoid a collision? Did he hit the brakes, swerve, and other things to try and remove himself from the situation? Then the courts will recognize that, and his charge will be reduced to involuntary manslaughter, and that might even be too serious. 

Or did he speed up, serve *into* the man, and go out of his way to hit them because they justified it by saying “Well if he didn’t want to get hit he shouldn’t have come onto the highway.” Then the courts will recognize that as well, and his charge will increase to vehicular homicide. 

That’s what your arguing. Your analogy completely takes away the responsibility of the motorist (assaulter) and places blame solely on what you perceive to be the mistakes (dressing “slutty” or going to a grimy bar) of the man running onto the highway (the woman). You’re also trying to use a situation where physics would play a role in the amount of time the situation could be remedied in comparison to a guy keeping his hands to himself, it’s asinine

The other thing that makes this fall through, and the biggest one in my mind, is that the basis of your argument is that women should be conscious of the men around them at all times, and dress to the occasion or act accordingly. To you, a woman dressed slutty is EXPECTED to be assaulted, the same way a man running into the highway is expected to be hit. That’s not a problem with the woman, that’s a problem with you. ","I would like to pick up on your hit by a car analogy because I think it’s a very good one.  I think you can go one step further and point out that when a women is assaulted it’s more like a car has swerved and deliberately hit the pedestrian.  I’m pretty sure we don’t have to point out to women the sad reality that they are not entirely safe and need to practice some vigilance.   At the same time, the parents of the world have some concern that they don’t want their daughters to confuse how the world should be and how they want the world to be with how it is.  ",0

dz1dxol,race,"I read the entire thing.  Even though I only have your side of the story, it sounds very much like you have thin skin and that she has been a good friend to you.  It sounds like she's trying to help you out and your taking it all as her looking down on you (and you seem to be attributing that, at least in part, to her being white and you being of color).  Your greivences are basically:

&gt; 1) She doesn't assume you know every minor political figure she brings up.  I don't even know what the problem is here.  Sure, you've probably heard of Farrakhan before, but it's not a slight to you that she doesn't just assume you do.

&gt; 2) She has offered you ""unsolicited"" advice.  This one is actually quite confusing.  It sounds like you've asked for her advice in the past.  In this case you were bringing up dissatisfaction with your job, and she gave you some advice.  It's pretty typical for friends to offer advice when someone brings up a problem -- particularly when they have sought your advice in the past.  I admit, the ""I give you permission"" thing is a bit odd, but it doesn't sound like that was anything other than a playful comment.

&gt; 3) She asked some questions of Amy that you thought were inappropriate.  I'm not even sure how this fits into the rest of the story.  Up till this point you seem to be complaining that your friend is condescending to you (at least partially due to race).  Now, you complain that she asked Amy some questions that were too personal.  Possibly they were, but it's very likely your friend recognized that there was a fascinating story there and she might not meet Amy again to learn about it.

It sounds like, at worst, your friend can be a bit condescending but that she's trying her best to help you out and she's done *a lot* for you.  Again, I get this having only heard your side of the story.  I don't see any evidence that she's looking down on you or taking you as a charity case because she is white and you are black -- that you come to this conclusion probably says more about you than about her.","Yeah...that's what i figured.

The proportion of ancestry that remains in present-day Oceanian populations after the Denisovan admixture is thus likely not much higher than the amount of Neanderthal ancestry that remains in non-Africans generally.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;These results provide evidence for low amounts of **Neanderthal ancestry in West Africa, consistent with previous results based on other approaches (15, 19), and we estimate this at 0.18%±0.06% in Yoruba** using an f4-ratio (assuming Mbuti has none). The most likely source for this is West Eurasian admixture (37),and assuming a simple linear relationship to Neanderthal ancestry, **our estimate implies 8.6%±3% Eurasian ancestry in Yoruba.**

5h9mg1,Incel,"Real Advice I'm about to give the advice that will leave this sub empty by next weekend so sit the fuck down and listen abnormies. 

The first step is to embrace sluts. I know you all like to hate on sluts, makeup, etc but that will get you nowhere. Do you really think some level-headed, loyal, girl next door type is going to imagine herself spending the rest of her life with some fat, pimpled neckbeard with autism and a micropenis? Your first few times are going to be with sluts so you can build confidence and practice so you can impress the lady of your dreams with your sexual skill.

2. You aren't all going to find love. Give it up. Those normies are lying to you. Most of them haven't even found someone who truly loves them. It's a pointless endeavor to focus on love. Be pragmatic, focus on finding someone to spend time with and have sex with. 

3. Most of the advice you are getting from normies suggests that you should become a normie or imitate normie behavior to get laid. That is complete and utter horseshit. What normies don't understand that I do, is that this advice is like telling a guy with a tiny dick to grow a big dig or telling a short guy to grow taller. 

What you really want to do is accentuate the things that you think are wrong with you. Have a tiny dick? That's your selling point. Fat and hairy? Flaunt it like a peacock's feathers. 

Somewhere out there right now there is a circus midget with a Megan Fox doppleganger sucking his cock like it's a triple fudge sundae because she thought he was cute. 

Don't try to figure out what women want and imitate it. Women are just as fucked as men. Just advertise what you already have that's unique. Avoid those normie dating sites and go on craigslist. Yes, craigslist. Post in casual encounters that you have a tiny dick that looks like a little turtle and you're looking for a hot babe that wants to play with it. If you have autism post that you're looking for a milf who wants to know what it's like to have Rain Man make it rain on her. 

Use craigslist, use reddit, join fetish websites and clubs. Find the sluts and advertise what you've got.

4gsstm,MEFetishism,"I'm pretty likely to kill myself due to this fetish I've lurked here for a good long time, have read most of Thirdwaytrans stuff and am just trying to make an honest living, laying low and making enough money to support this apartment shared by my brother and I. The problem is, this fetish. No matter what I do, where I go, what I think, it's always on my mind. All I can think about is sucking dick and becoming a tranny pornstar, which makes it harder and harder to maintain my ""mask"" if that's what's you want to call it, idk.

The masturbation compulsion just depresses me and destroys my mental health to say the least. I went from jerking off once a day, for fun and forgetting about the fetish after I was satisfied, to jerking off twice a day, to having severe panic attacks, anxiety and OCD. I hate being a sissy. I despise being a masochist. I really feel like death will bring me the release I need from my intense emotions. I guess my brother, father and mother would be sad, but that doesn't matter to me at all because I'll cease to exist. I bitched out of my first suicide attempt, but if my dad leaves his house door unlocked for a night, I'm very tempted to just take his shotgun and put it to my head. At least I can die like a man.

I think there are some individuals on this earth who clearly aren't capable of coping with extreme hardships and I think I'm one of them. I can hear ""accept it"" ""embrace it"", etc all damn day, but the problem is I cannot control that my mind is not capable of doing these things. I am just not in a place in life where I can just ""accept"" these urges and desires.","You would be making a tragic and unnecessary mistake. The fetish has its own built in safety net of no matter how low you sink into being a sissy homosexual it will continue to provide you with erotic pleasure. You need to abandon the macho values and do whatever it takes to save your life. 

Millions of people on Earth are masochists, it doesn't make them bad or inferior. Try to create a separation between how you feel about your core self and what arouses you sexually. Don't judge yourself entirely based on your sexuality, there is more to life than being straight, gay, sissy, or whatever. 

And anyway, gay and trans acceptance are widespread now in many parts of the Western world, you don't have to die.

ekz17sn,Homophobes,"I'm pretty gay. You know, when I see a straight couple, it may shock you, but I don't immediately think about them bashing bits if they're just living their lives out in public. Most of my friends are in straight relationships or are looking for one, and I don't feel the need to speculate about the sexual aspects that may or may not be present. Right now, the only bits I'm really interested about in that way belong to my boyfriend. 

I feel like a lot of straight people don't have that attitude towards gay people, though. And because of that, there's kind of a double standard in terms of what I can do in public with my boyfriend versus what a straight couple would be able to do. For example, even though I'm in a relatively accepting area, I still don't feel safe doing something as simple as holding hands with him walking down the street together. Meanwhile, nobody would bat an eye at a straight couple doing the exact same thing. I think that part of the reason why this may be is because some straight people don't see gay people as people because they see sexuality and romance in terms of an ethics of purity and degradation.

But what does that mean? Well, it's a moral view that portrays good as the abhorrence of the disgusting. It underlies the widespread idea that the body is a temple which can be desecrated by immoral activities and contaminants. By itself, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It can provide a basis for moral thought that people who want to live in a more elevated and less carnal way can follow. 

But, because this way of thinking about morality can often conflict with other ideas about morality, like philosophies that focus more on autonomy/oppression, and fairness/injustice, if gay people are the objects of your disgust, then unreasoning abbhorence will lead to you trampling over the other moral concepts like liberty and justice in order to ""purge the impure"", even if they have all the same right as you to exist and live their lives. All of this, of course, for no other reason other than because you're just disgusted by them deep down. 

And this form of ethics doesn't just hurt gay people. It hurts straight people too. Think about it like this. How many times have you heard the phrase ""Fellas, is it gay if...""? Often, what's being asked isn't even involving sexual intercourse with a person of the same gender. It's stuff like ""Is it gay to like having your nipples sucked by a girl?"" or ""Is it gay to have a girl peg you?"". Since both of those things are heterosexual sexual activities, they are *checks notes* not gay. But the purpose of the question isn't to be reasonable, it is to keep enforcing that same ethics of purity, stopping straight people from doing what they want with their bodies. 

This creates a double standard, where any deviance from an assigned sexual or romantic role is seen as a grievous sin, worthy of punishment and eradication. That's the thought process behind the kind of violence I'm afraid might hurt me, and is already hurting thousands of queer people around the world. So, while I am a gay person, and not disgusted by straight sex at all, homophobes are, and will use that disgust as a moral excuse to restrict my rights and be violent towards me.",Exactly,0

drrvd75,TheCalmBeforeTheStorm,"&gt; So the United States Navy is monitoring twitter trends?

a branch of the most powerful armed forces on earth monitoring global trends? say it ain't so!

i'm all for draining the swamp and Trump busting the deep state, but please. you're being a bit sensationalist with this line","No I don't.  Why is the navy being used if all they are doing is monitoring.  A computer could search for basic words and this would be the purview of the FBI or CIA or NSA. These agencies employee a massive number of employees and contractors.  CBTS says the CIA needs to be reduced in number by 70%.  So these bloated in size agencies that are partly funded by the Rothschilds so that they can exceed their charter and budget still don't have enough employees to monitor twitter trends?   Monitoring twitter trends is what they admitted to.  

So you equate global trends with social media and you think they are JUST monitoring with all the censorship and cheating on twitter?  I wonder if that is how they phrase it to the navy boys they order to do the work. Despite the fact that this information comes out on the morning the JA's twitter went out for hours and the accident tweet was about JA?  It makes me ask myself are blue shirts being ordered to manipulate Twitter and create those trends.  

I have always wondered who they can get to manipulate social media.  Military makes sense; Trained to take orders and serious consequences for refusing.  So is monitoring twitter trends, and manipulating the outcome possibly is a military op?  And all those pedophiles on Twitter and other illegal crap is ignored and allowed.  And that is okay with you?  The Navy is at the very least monitoring and reporting a journalists comments and his account gets deleted as he is about to leak proof of government crimes and corruption. Then one of the navy blue shirts rebels and leaves a fingerprint in the form of tweet to let us know what happened.  I am betting that guy or girl is in the brig and being made an example of.  This is the age of the information war.  No trenches but war none the less. 

So what does Q say about Social media?  It is a creation by the CIA to monitor and manage the populace.  Another means of control hidden in whats billed as a leisure social activity.  What was the effect of twitter on our recent elections and shaping pubic opinion?  How many people voted for HRC because they read on social media/news that Bernie cant w/new Bernie cant win.  And on and on.  Manipulating social media is social engineering.  This is animal farm, dystopia, and it is not freedom.  

If you also work for the Navy or any other agency where you are not free to safely make choices without terrible consequences I am praying for u.  I want you, or anyone in that situation to be safe.  Bid your time.  Enough of the truth is out now.  Pray for POTUS, for DOD, for freedom.  ",0

e6ky5yc,anarchy,"If you work for yourself, aren't you a capitalist. Especially if you run your own business.","Hi.  Thanks for asking.  I'm going to simplify since we're starting from the beginning.

The fundamental feature of capitalism is the relationship between the employer and employee.  The employee works, and through work creates value.  The employer takes that entire amount, subtracts costs (including the wage of the employee), and keeps the rest.  ""The rest"" is the profit.

Since I work for myself, I keep the entire value I create (minus costs).  That's simply trade.  

If I hired an employee and paid less than value created minus cost, then I would be a capitalist.  I would keep part of what they created as my profit.

8nyh3t,RedPillWomen,"I keep ending up with beta males. What am I doing wrong? I am usually attracted to them because they are usually nerdy and passionate about science and stuff like that.  I don't mind that they don't work out if they have good genes and maintain a normal, healthy male figure, even if it's on the *slender* side...

We have fun together...we can talk into the night..and the sex is okay too.

But then it starts happening...they get clingy, make me the focus of their existence... something will happen in a social situation and they'll freeze and I'll have to take over...so I start to lose attraction for them and *then* I start being a little snarky here and there which makes them try *harder*, which makes me more angry.....rinse and repeat.

I have been attracted to men who seem normal and a little bit nerdy at first but then become full blown betas after a few months.

I hate how I react to it, it's like they bring out the worst of my female nature.

The one I'm with now has just tipped over this point. But let's face it: beta males have some traits that are very appealing in this day and age: loyal, passionate, smart, successful, quick learners....

I don't want to lost this guy.

So I suppose I have 2 questions:

1) What is it about me that keeps attracting betas? I am a fit, very attractive and successful woman. I've always liked skinny, kinda nerdy guys. 

2) Can my relationship with my beta tendency man now be saved? Or is it just game over?

I don't mean to say that older gay people can't still be activists or that being gay becomes less important, I just think that for most people being gay becomes less performative once you realize you can just live a normal life. At the university where I work our ""queer"" student group is very young, vibrant, outspoken, and 75% of them are straight girls calling themselves poly and transmasculine. Meanwhile my gay, middle-aged boss just lives quietly with his partner and finds modern queer politics totally cringey.

Edit for errors.","I completely agree, but for me personally I'm drifting more towards the ""fuck you I'm a lesbian"" side, but that's exclusively because of all the homophobia from TRAs and to a lesser extent ""bisexuals"" pushing the sexuality is fluid sentiment.

i don't have much of a community re: trauma but honest to god, blogging on tumblr has helped me find a few people i can count on. i hesitate to recommend tumblr to anyone but it worked for me... lol. through those connections i found a couple of private online groups for lesbian trauma recovery.

the past few weeks i've been doubling down on exercise and focusing on things that are helpful but kind of mindless, like cleaning my apartment and eating healthy. so i've been feeling a bit better physically even though none of my problems are solved, lol.

as far as money goes, it's a triggering subject but i'm working on it too as much as i can. i'm still dependent on my mom for help paying my rent (which also makes me feel bad because she's not rich), but i found online work i can do from home and though i have terrible concentration issues sometimes it really helps to lose myself in it.

on days when i feel optimistic, my thinking is basically- if i can get my health back up and work on my credit, then i can think about getting a proper job at some point. when i get there, i can get back into the habit of socializing. maybe just by focusing on small things that i feel i can handle, i can slowly and steadily rebuild the shambles of my life.

also, people who have a more conflict oriented personality gain more respect than typical nice guys who won't argue with someone just so that they do not hurt their feelings, or because they are nice/homely type of person.

All the evidence points to the fact that Brown tried to get his hand on the Officers gun. According to the law, that is all that is required for a cop to eliminate a threat. 
You also seem to forget that not even 9 of the 12 person jury found evidence that Wilson was in the wrong. ","There are things you left out. If Brown I(after grabbing Wilson and being shot) had died there at that moment then that would have been one thing. But Brown took off, and when he turned to move back towards Wilson, he was wounded but Wilson wasn't. Wilson didn't have to kill him. Also, Wilson isn't a midget. He's over six foot himself, and has been on the force long enough to know how to handle himself in these situations. He simply didn't have to kill the kid.

dkrmhm,TGandSissyRecovery,"My story I have been essentially jerking off to dominant women most of my teenage years. I seemed to have a sexual obsession for leather as a kid (6th grade) and started looking at picture of women dressed in dominatrix style clothing. That was my equivalent of typing ""naked girl"" into google images.

For the first year it was mostly pictures, I didn't even know how to masturbate so I would just watch these photos and feel aroused. One day one of my classmates raged about how great it is to jerk off so I tried it at home and after a lot of work it was a very intense feeling. The next few months I would ejaculate exclusively by looking at pictures of these 'dominant' women and quite a bit later in pornos.

Fast forward a bit, I went to camp around 7th grade and fell in love with a girl hard. And when I mean hard I mean 6 months of thinking about her everyday and having sever heartache to the point of wanting to throw up and thinking about wether I could live without her e.i. Mild Romeo and Julie suicidal thoughts  . For some context she was living in another country.

That essentially froze my heart for the next 3 years, I couldn't get infatuated by any girl. While I was still attracted to them I never had any crushes or admiration for anyone throughout all of high school. During this time I was watching mostly femdom porn which drove me into a deep rabbit hole of worse and harsher varieties. At one point I would watch blood play, whipping etc.

That was until last year, a little after New Year I discovered the sissy porn. But it wasn't the pornography that drove me to it but rather the amount of content, communities, role play sites, virtual teases, games that it had to offer. I am fortunate that I never got into the hypno stuff apart from the occasional gifs and one or two ventures into HFO content. Along with that I am also fortunate that I never got much into crossdressing to the point of purchasing any clothing or toys.

But man the games were the ones that got me. There was some sort of trigger in my head that made me enjoy these games where you started as a man and ended up as a sissy that captured my imagination and my time. I would get off work, get in bed and play these games for hours. I was hooked and started spending $50-100/month (a lot of money for an entry level 18 year old) on these game creators patreons to get extra features and early releases.

My first steps to recovery: I met a girl on vacation that I started having feelings for, two weeks of my life where I lost my virginity and stopped watching porn. What scared me however the most was that I was not able to finish. I would get hard but I couldn't get myself to cum, while it was a blast for her, 40-120 minutes of uninterrupted intercourse I ended up feeling empty and void. This was over the summer, and the period after it was when my addiction to that sort of content amplified. More money spent, more hours wasted.

Three weeks ago she decided to visit me in my home country. During this period was the first time I was able to ejaculate from that type of stimulation and I saw that there was hope.

I dedicated myself to noSissy porn and only vanilla after that. It's been two weeks and I am going strong. I deleted my accounts for all these sissy related sites and hard blocked the site where I could find these sissy games along with my porn email account, reddit and patreon.

I know my experience isn't as tough as many on this platform, I just wanted to put my story out there. It just feels like a sort of therapy for me.

This is a way to block sites from being able to load on your mac computer. While you can always unblock it the process is a barrier to your urges and most of the time I find myself to lazy to unblock the sites that I wanted to access and switched to normal vanilla porn. Eventually I want to try and write a program that blocks all sites that mention sissy + porn which can only be turned off with some kind of puzzle or something, I don't know yet.

aa5ecy,ChapoTrapHouse,"An open letter to Donald Trump and Washington Hello Washingtonites,

Dear President Trump and The Swamp,

Sitting back and watching the wall and whether it should be done, I ask?

Why has no one - mentioned - the uninoculated masses sitting on our border? 
What? I am sure they have all the proper immunizations!

So Mr. Shumer and Ms. Pelosi,
I am sending random immigrant's, to live with you and your families. You children, cousins and family.
I am also taking special pains to ensure the little ones accompany you both on live TV. They will need hugged, held and nursed back to health. Oh, yes, I forgot to tell you. TB, Typhoid, Measles and Mumps to name a few.

To California, the schools that have so many immigrant children now, I give the really ill children. Why? because you want to be a safe zone for them, the ill ones are yours. By the way no funding for medicines or vaccines. Your own California's will foot the bill.


To those who want to let them in as they are. Sign up today. You will get to sponsor, feed, immunize and clothe them at your expense. 


Merry Christmas! Ha Ha Ha.


President Trump; continue your course of action. Stand up to our own terrorist groups headed by Nancy and Chuck! They want to impeach you? Charge them with treason. Trial and then send them out of this great country!

3reed2,MEFetishism,"From being the sissy, to making the sissy? For a few years now, I've indulged in sissy fantasies, both in private AND real life. Nowadays, I'm pretty bored of being the sissy and have moved on to ""making"" sissies do humiliating things for me. Something about a male that would get all dolled up just to be fucked and please me at any cost is a huge turn on to me.

I still have lots of fantasies where I'm the sissy myself, but I can get an equal orgasm from seeing myself as the person fucking the sissy. Weird. I'm mostly confused because I thought that the fetish meant I was quite clearly a sub. I can't really get off on cuckold stuff, but I can get off a little on other forms of humiliation. 

I REALLY get off however on being ""hyperdominant"" as well, and basically forcing girls or sissy boys to do the stuff I'd do, like using naked girls as a footstool.
