7,2,Your attitude is the reason feminism exists. It is a response to unequal treatment. Fix your attitude and all this feminism stuff goes away. Deal?,"What the hell would you know about my ""attitude""?"
8,0,"Critically it got pretty good reviews, and the director's cut is much better. Certainly has it's problems, like the aforementioned moron characters, but of all the criticism it did receive, none of it was because it had a female lead.  &#x200B;  >!Then in Alien Covenant they just kill her off screen for no good reason.!<",Critic reviews are maybe the least relevant way to measure if a movie is good or not lol

14,0,"Can you not read? I said ""some odd version of..."" As in we currently don't have a catchy term for people who go around acting like they're happy that they were mutilated as a baby and that everything is cool.  It's like your embracing the idea that this terrible shit that was done to you was somehow good.    ""I'm just so glad my parents decided to cut my pinky toes off.

18,0,This is why the idea for colleges to force students to sign sex contracts before each time pissed me off so much. Not to mention consent can be withdrawn during so it doesn’t prove anything anyways.,You can also claim you were pressured or forced to sign the agreement
19,0,"Yes, I know a lot of women get pregnant on purpose in order to trap a man they want.

23,2,Men don’t get celebrated for the sacrifice and hard work they’ve been doing everyday and throughout history.

29,2,Man up you little dick sissies.,You missed the point that is your dick. I can play that game.
30,0,"It doesn't work like this.  In this case, the initiating party - male or female - is held to be responsible.  If only one party is drunk, then whoever is sober is at fault, regardless of gender or who initiated, is at fault.  And there are a reason for these laws; they're not to allow people 'revenge' for their regretted 'decisions', they are to prevent anyone - male or female - from taking advantage of someone with reduced capability for rational decision.  Is a contract signed when drunk valid? Of course not. There is no reason to expect consenting to sex when drunk to be valid either.   /edit Oh dear, I told some truths that contradict some people's view of reality. I am soooo sorry.

37,2,"No.  It's more convenient for someone to have their shit right next to them where they can see it and it's safe rather than tucked away under their feet or whatever. This is a perfectly acceptable thing to do unless it becomes an inconvenience to someone else.  Just grow some fucking balls and ask ""Excuse me, do you mind popping your stuff on the floor so I can sit there?""  If the person says anything other than something that doesn't mean ""Yes, I'll do that for you."" then they're an asshole.  If you presume that just because it's a woman doing it then they're a hypocrite because she's probably the first to complain of manspreading then you're the asshole.

I make more than my female coworkers because I showed some balls during negotiations
44,0,"I think most people would agree with you that neither should be charged. It's absolutely absurd. The comments calling for her to be charged are likely just reactionary. If he is going to be charged so should she... Equality and all that. Ideally, however, absurd child pornography charges shouldn't be brought against minors at all.  ",The only thing worse than charging both of them is charging one of them.

49,0,"You know, sometimes it can be appropriate to blame the victim for something they wore and sometimes it isn't.  ""You were raped because you wore a short skirt"" is not the same thing as ""People were offended because they think your shirt is sexist.""  Regardless of whether or not you think the shirt actually *was* sexist (it made me roll my eyes, but that's about it) is not the point. If I wore a shirt that said ""FUCK NIGGERS"" on it, and got yelled at, do you *really* think that's a victim-blaming issue?

60,1,"No, because this is what feminists believe, even when they're in the mainstream they still follow this line of thinking about men to some degree or other.

64,0,"If you're male and in the USA, make a sexual harassment complaint against the school because of this.

330,0,Here is the thing. I actually agree with the sentiment that male circumsion hurts women. Probably not for the same reasons as that article. But I'll explain.  Circumsion is literally male genitalia mutilation. You are literally lopping off a part of a mans penis when you circumsize him. Now it may not have any major effect on their life. But its true. Its normalizing genitalia mutilation. Which also harms women because it being normalized means people start thinking its okay to do to women. Which its not. Because it can have a major effect on a womans life. Up to and including them not being able to have pleasure during sex.   So yes i do think circumsion (aka male genitalia mutilation) does have a negative impact on women.   I also think that circumsion its self needs to be reevaluated. There is no non religious reason as to why circumsion is necessary. And while typically it does no harm. That shouldn't be a reason to continue an ancient amd archaic practice.,"You’re a gynocentrist, Harry!"

They claim that 1 in 3 women are sexually assaulted but again that info comes from a survey where an unwanted hug was deemed sexual assault,Says he had evidence. Doesn't have evidence.

We should be fighting against that social injustice, not also ""crying rape"" because that's the way it would play out if the roles were reversed.  I agree, I don't read rape in that story.  If the roles were reversed the guy could probably be accused of rape and have his life ruined and that fucking sucks.

453,0,"According to the law, yes. In fact, any sex (consensual or otherwise) involving anyone under sixteen is legally considered statutory rape in the eyes of the law, at least in my state. That means two fifteen year olds can have sex, and according to the legal system they're raping each other (although the male, if there is one, is the only one likely to be charged if it comes before a court of law).","That's a weird law, I think that's actually rare."

Sounds like Demi hired a girl to sit in a guy’s room, and then the girl acted on her own afterwards.   Hiring a prostitute would have been a funny prank if it were a guy who hired her.

It's a large factor in producing peadophiles, but there is no evidence to suggest it accounts for a large number of rapists as well.  Rape culture is more complicated than ""those guys were all raped as kids"", I would suggest that the societal pressures on guys to lose their virginity and to 'score' at a young age are huge factors in rape culture.

845,0,"So, here's something interesting to think about.  the above is clearly predicated on the idea that all males want sex all the time from any and all women.  That idea is kept alive and current by the following mechanism:  It is ~~illegal~~ ~~immoral~~ against the rules for a man to say that he *does not* find a woman attractive.  In nearly any circumstance,  a man stating that he does not find a particular woman attractive will be interpreted to mean that he hates all women or he is gay.  Women can freely talk about their attraction to particular men and their lack of attraction to others.  Women are free to say that any particular man,  or any group of men,  or even *all* men are unattractive,  men are not free to make such distinctions.

It's too bad there's no men's counter campaigns to tell young men it's OK not to be sexual 100% of your life or that it's OK to not even like sex at all.

1272,0,Does testosterone provide an unfair advantage with regards to non-physical sports as well?  I ask this because the competitive sport of chess is also split into gendered leagues. This is a game involving minimal physical involvement but instead has a core focus on memorization and spacial awareness. Separating players based on their sex in this sport implies that one group possesses an advantage over the other; but what might that advantage be?  Is it really gender related?  It should be noted that many highly-rated female players choose not to play in the female-exclusive league. This is exceptionally admirable as it demonstrates integrity and encourages competition: some of these players could find easier money in the female-exclusive league but choose to compete in the environment offering the most challenge.,Cycling steroids did wonders for my chess career.

On the topic of evolution and human sexuality, I’ve taught for 28 years, written 4 books and over 100 academic publications, given 190 talks, reviewed papers for over 50 journals, and mentored 11 Ph.D. students. Whoever the memo’s author is, he has obviously read a fair amount about these topics. Graded fairly, his memo would get at least an A- in any masters’ level psychology course.

You can find them [here - APA](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/10/recidivism.aspx) and [here -  some global organization called Penal Reform](https://www.penalreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/brf-03-2008-women-in-prison-en.pdf).  My suspicion is that the phrase ""designed for men"" purports that prison as a systematic penal system was ultimately designed for the typical male offenders at the typical male rates and types of offending.

So the cutting of girls' genitals in Sudan is done over the objections of *both* fathers and husbands. It is nearly a 100% female-run project, done by older women on younger women.

Does the fact that they had sex establish a de facto agreement to have a child?  Does everyone here just want to outlaw abortions unless both mother and father sign off?

2382,0,With all the porn and random people posting adult pics here on reddit.......i can say it seems to be on a rapid decline anyway.   Im starting to feel like a minority being cut,Could be because non-american atheists (europeans etc.) post more and more.
2383,2,"Who cares?  You can find a single example of a woman getting the raw end of the law and a single example of a man walking free and put them side by side and it proves nothing.    If you want to pose an argument use actual data across a large sample size to see if there's an issue or not (there is, but fuck this bullshit emotional knee jerk baiting horseshit)",Find one example of a woman getting punished for consensual sex.  I'll wait.
2384,0,"Well, she is right. She fucked up. She should have just kept the anecdote vague enough so nobody could prove it to be bullshit. /s  It makes you wonder if she honestly remembered it that way. If not, what made her think the guy was just going to stand by and let her make him look like an asshole?  ",you tell yourself a lie enough it becomes the truth... at least to you.

What a world we live in...","A registered sex offender FOR LIFE, you mean. "
2389,1,"It's not stupid, if we prosecute people that voluntarily confess to putting people in jail because of false accusations then the voluntary confessions would stop  People in this thread are calling for years of jailtime and even death penalty.

2390,0,"Her book actually got me back into reading again, as she has such a funny and clever writing style. The chapter on dating was very interesting when she goes in feeling arrogant and gets destroyed repeatedly.  Ultimately though I find her to still be shallow and innately hostile to men, with idiotic non scientific assumptions like, ""men only look at you when they want to kill you or fuck you "" As if mutual cooperation and self disposibility hasn't been crucual survival aspects for the human species.  All the groups she joins are often the lowest common denominator, not once does she seek out a normal and well adjusted group of guys. But at least she dropped half her preconcieved notions and hopefully it inspires others to do the same.",How is a group of friends bowling not well adjusted?
2391,0,After some phone chat a drunken woman comes to my place and we have sex. She can no even walk and falls asleep while doing fellatio.

2399,2,Don't go after the women for recanting false accusations. Otherwise in the future people will never recant and innocent people will be stuck imprisoned for longer.

He's 8, he's alive, and according to the story, now in a loving home and slated to make a full recovery.  There will always be baggage, but I know plenty of abuse victims who hate when people think that they're permanently broken as a person because of what happened to them as a child.  Don't get me wrong, they're shit people and they deserve everything they get, but I'd rather they lose the prime of their life, go free, and try to live out their old age as ex-cons than have them grow old and die in prison as a taxpayer burden.

2402,2,so a sub is created to denounce a men’s rights sub-  i think u/tamagnocci was spot on.    of course this is encouraged because it’s reddit.   you can get banned for questioning 33 genders but celebrated for threatening our president.,Because our president fucking blows.

2408,2,"Man, another one? You wrote two stupid as fuck posts. Look, we understand it's the law you idiot. It isn't right though. Do you understand that? That sometimes the law is flawed? Stupid shit like this will keep happening unless we're willing to have a conversation about it.   We've all had sex at 17 (except you), so that means we're all criminals right?

2410,2,"Need a citation on strokes, I can only find studies that say women lead by a significant margin.  Heart disease in general needs a revamp. (cholesterol particle size matters!) but as far as increased risk for men, is it genetic or lifestyle?   Aids is already in multiple programs, but targeting homosexuals and drug addicts mostly.   Suicideis horrible, mental health needs a massive revamp, and stigma needs to be removed! But the majority of mental health is a doctor giving you medication, which is not enough... Followed by articles reporting 'over prescribing'. It's a shit show! Especially for veterans.  Work place deaths gets me pissed off. Because it's typically profit versus workplace safety.

2415,0,"As a trans woman and a victim of domestic violence(back when I was on the masculine side of things.) the way abused men in society are treated is out right shameful. They are treated like the abuser, instead of the victim. And when I needed help there was none available for men. The closest thing that they had was a group for  abusers to reform. There are literally 100s of programs for women. Not a single one for men. It's fucking shameful.     It's still something that makes me very emotional. And I speak out about it a lot.

2416,2,"On September 29, 2016 Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation (Assembly Bill 1732) after being approved by the Assembly and Senate which meant California became the first state in the US to require all single-occupancy public toilets to be unisex since March 1, 2017   Urinals do not count as a toilet, so a mens room with a urinal and a toilet (most of these small bathrooms) has to be made unisex because it is single occupancy, while the women's rooms tend to have two stalls.

Tomi is just blonde and loud, not as well known, and a bigger example of why we are all fucked. Cardi seems to have committed crimes on her way out of poverty, but at least she's not raping America continuously with hateful shit.   Look at the image again. The ""left"" is the problem?? What a bunch of manufactured garbage. Tomi isn't making any headlines about right darlings, systematic destruction of Americans by traditional right supporters/defenders.

2761,0,"Spoilers obviously:  Last season we saw through Bran that Jon Snow wasn't actually Ned Stark's bastard son. He's actually the son of Rhaegar Targaryn and Lyanna Stark (Ned's sister). Rhaegar was already married to Elia Martell (Oberon Martell's sister) when the rebellion started, so any children of his affair with Lyanna would be bastard and not really that important.  However! Gily just discovered that Rhaegar actually had his marriage with Elia annulled and then married Lyanna. This means that Jon Snow isn't actually a bastard, he's the trueborn son of the Crown Prince. Which means he is actually the legal heir to the Iron Throne. His claim even supersedes Dany's claim to the Throne since the line of succession follows the trueborn male heirs of the Prince before the prince's siblings.

The things we shouldn't do? We end up doing it. We speak our minds when sober we would shut up. There are lots of claims that we ""let loose"" and do the things we're afraid to do.   Yet, when a woman gets drunk and suddenly wants to engage in sex... she's not letting loose her inhibitions? She doesn't want to have sex after all?  Or does she want to do the things she holds back on, then regrets it later and cries rape when she sees things on Facebook?  In wine there is truth.

It's because the article is trying to paint her in a favorable light, as being the victim and not the perpetrator, and using the word ""seduce"" to imply it was consensual (it was not, for children can't give consent). It is meant to mislead by making you focus on the fact the boy was asking her out, when in fact that should not fucking matter at all.

Jesus, the comments here decrying women for wanting consent are just as bad the screenshot the post is about. If there is a question of consent, you should know, it's pretty fucking obvious, & if it's not you can say things like ""you like it when i do this? where do you want me to put (x)?"" so that you offer her opportunities to opt out.

This simply isn’t a problem for those who are circumcised because they’ve lost sensitivity.  The argument that “it’s cleaner” is simply false in modern times since most people shower everyday.   It’s a very touchy subject to discuss with those that have been circumcised because telling another grown man his sexual experience is diminished is painful.

But, sometimes it makes me feel like there’s no point in me wanting to be a mom in my future, since it feels like moms aren’t as crucial in good outcomes.

505,1,Here is the thing. I actually agree with the sentiment that male circumsion hurts women. Probably not for the same reasons as that article. But I'll explain.  Circumsion is literally male genitalia mutilation. You are literally lopping off a part of a mans penis when you circumsize him. Now it may not have any major effect on their life. But its true. Its normalizing genitalia mutilation. Which also harms women because it being normalized means people start thinking its okay to do to women. Which its not. Because it can have a major effect on a womans life. Up to and including them not being able to have pleasure during sex.   So yes i do think circumsion (aka male genitalia mutilation) does have a negative impact on women.   I also think that circumsion its self needs to be reevaluated. There is no non religious reason as to why circumsion is necessary. And while typically it does no harm. That shouldn't be a reason to continue an ancient amd archaic practice.,you're a fucknut.

Trayvon Martin was on top of George Zimmerman attempting to bash his skull into the pavement for just following him when he was shot.

679,1,"Makes sense but you're attacking a straw man.   Sexual objectification is treating someone as a mere object of pleasure.   It refers to men that only think of women as pussy but otherwise vapid children. Wealth rose. Women didn't need to work. They weren't valued for anything else. The history of women's value is a rollercoaster, very interesting. Anyway for awhile it was iconic masculinity, agree?  It was unchallenged in songs, advertisement, all expressions. But women started challenging it. A lot of men listened. Fewer and fewer men feel this way, but the denial of the intellectual value of women didn't disappear overnight.  These assholes lurk everywhere, and it's very hard to challenge them when they're older or powerful. Sometimes it's status quo. Sometimes it's dismissed as a quirk.   I know I said straw man earlier, but there are indeed some freaky people that think all sex is violence, far out shit. All groups have people that push it too far, right?
